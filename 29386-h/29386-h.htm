<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>This volume is devoted to a choice collection of the standard and new
fairy-tales, wonder stories, and fables. They speak so truly and convincingly
for themselves that we wish to use this introductory page only
to emphasize their value to young children. There are still those who find no
room in their own reading, and would give none in the reading of the young,
except for facts. They confuse facts and truth, and forget that there is a world
of truth that is larger than the mere facts of life, being compact of imagination
and vision and ideals. Dr. Hamilton Wright Mabie convinced us of this in his
cogent words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;America,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has at present greater facility in producing &lsquo;smart&rsquo;
men than in producing able men; the alert, quick-witted money-maker abounds,
but the men who live with ideas, who care for the principles of things, and who
make life rich in resource and interest, are comparatively few. America needs
poetry more than it needs industrial training, though the two ought never to be
separated. The time to awaken the imagination, which is the creative faculty,
is early childhood, and the most accessible material for this education is the literature
which the race created in its childhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The value of the fairy-tale and the wonder-tale is that they tell about the
magic of living. Like the old woman in Mother Goose, they &ldquo;brush the cobwebs
out of the sky.&rdquo; They enrich, not cheapen, life. Plenty of things do
cheapen life for children. Most movies do. Sunday comic supplements do.
Ragtime songs do. Mere gossip does. But fairy stories enhance life.</p>

<p>They are called &ldquo;folk-tales,&rdquo; that is, tales of the common folk. They were
largely the dreams of the poor. They consist of fancies that have illumined
the hard facts of life. They find animals, trees, flowers, and the stars friendly.
They speak of victory. In them the child is master even of dragons. He can
live like a prince, in disguise, or, if he be uncomely, he may hope to win Beauty
after he is free of his masquerade.</p>

<p>Wonder-stories help make good children as well as happy children. In these
stories witches, wolves, and evil persons are defeated or exposed. Fairy godmothers
are ministers of justice. The side that the child wishes to triumph
always does triumph, and so goodness always is made to seem worth-while.</p>

<p>Almost every fairy-tale contains a test of character or shrewdness or courage.
Sharp distinctions are made, that require a child of parts to discern.</p>

<p>And the heroes of these nursery tales are much more convincing than precepts
or golden texts, for they impress upon the child not merely what he ought
to do, but what nobly has been done. And the small hero-worshiper will follow
where his admirations lead.</p>

<p>Fables do much the same, and by imagining that the animals have arrived
at human speech and wisdom, they help the child to think shrewdly and in a
friendly way, as if in comradeship with his pets and with our brothers and
sisters, the beasts of the field and forest.</p>

<h2>THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS GOLDENLOCKS</h2>

<p>There was once a lovely Princess who had
such beautiful golden hair that everyone called
her Goldenlocks. She possessed everything that
she wanted: she was lovely to look at, she had
beautiful clothes, and great wealth, and besides
all these, she was the Princess in a large kingdom.</p>

<p>In the country next to that of Goldenlocks
there ruled a rich and handsome young King.
When he heard about the charming Princess he
decided that he wanted her for his Queen. The
question was, of course, how to make her feel
that she wanted him for her husband!</p>

<p>This young King did not go about his wooing
after the manner of people that you and I know.
He called one of the chief men of his court, and
said: &ldquo;You have heard of the lovely Princess
Goldenlocks. I have determined that she shall
be my bride. I want you to go and see her; tell
her about me, and beg her to become my Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the King ordered a great number of
horses brought for the ambassador, and he directed
his men to send more than a hundred
servants also. You see, in that way he hoped
to be able to impress the Princess with his
wealth and importance.</p>

<p>The King was conceited, and did not think for
a moment that any Princess, no matter how beautiful,
would refuse to become his wife. So he
ordered his servants to make great preparations
for her coming, and to refurnish the palace. He
told his ambassador to be sure to bring the Princess
back with him.</p>

<p>The King waited with great impatience for the
return of the ambassador, who had quite a long
journey to make before he could get to the court
of the Princess Goldenlocks. Then one day he
appeared in the King&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my lovely bride?&rdquo; the King asked
eagerly, expecting the ambassador to say that
she was in the next room, and would come in
at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied the ambassador, very
sadly, &ldquo;I could not bring the Princess to you.
She sent you her thanks for your offer, but she
could not accept the gifts which you sent her,
and she will not marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; the King exclaimed indignantly, as
he fingered the pearls and diamonds which he
had sent Goldenlocks, and which she had sent
back. &ldquo;I and my jewels are not good enough
for the Princess Goldenlocks!&rdquo; And the King
cried and cried, just as if he had not been
grown up.</p>

<p>All the people in the court were greatly disturbed
because the ambassador had failed in his
mission. They felt themselves injured to think
that Goldenlocks would not marry their King.
There was one courtier, named Charming, who
felt especially bad, for he was very fond of the
King. He even said one day that he was certain
that if the King had only let him go to
Goldenlocks, she would have consented to a royal
marriage.</p>

<p>Now, there were in that court some very jealous
men, who thought that Charming was altogether
too great a favorite with the King. When
they heard him say that he could have won Goldenlocks
for his master, they got together and
agreed to tell the King that Charming was making
silly boasts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; one of them said, &ldquo;Charming
told us that if you had let him go to Goldenlocks
she would never have refused to marry you.
He thinks that he is so attractive that the Princess
would have fallen in love with him immediately,
and would have consented to go anywhere
he wished with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; the King exclaimed. &ldquo;And I thought
he was my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, you and I know that if the King
himself had been any sort of a friend he would
never have doubted the good faith of Charming
just because someone else spoke evil of him. But
what did the King do but order Charming put
into a dungeon and given no food or water, so
that the poor fellow should die of hunger!</p>

<p>Poor Charming was bewildered when the
King&#8217;s guards came to carry him off to prison.
He could not imagine why the King had turned
against him in this unfair way. It made him
miserable enough to be in a cold, damp cell, with
no food to eat, and no water to drink except that
from a little stream which flowed through the
cell. He had no bed&mdash;just a dirty pile of straw.
But all these discomforts were as nothing to the
worry he had as to why the King, whom he
had always liked, had treated him so unjustly.
He used to talk to himself about it. One day he
said, as he had thought dozens of times before:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done that my kindest friend, to
whom I have always been faithful, should have
turned against me and left me to die in this
prison cell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the King himself was
passing by the dungeon where Charming was confined
when he spoke these words, and the King
heard them. Perhaps the King&#8217;s better self had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
been telling him that he ought at least to have
given Charming a chance to tell his side of the
story before condemning him to die. I do not
know. At any rate when he heard this voice
coming out of the dungeon he insisted on going
in at once to see Charming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Gracious Majesty,&rdquo; said Charming, &ldquo;I
could not believe that it was really your wish
that I be confined in this cell. All my life I have
had no wish but to serve you faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; the King exclaimed, &ldquo;can this be
true! They told me that you have made fun of
me because the Princess Goldenlocks had refused
to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Your Majesty, mocked you?&rdquo; Charming
was astonished. &ldquo;That is not true. It is true,
however, that I said that if you would send me
to Goldenlocks I believed I could persuade her
to become your wife, because I know so many
good things about you which I would tell her. I
could paint such a lovely picture of you that she
could not possibly help falling in love with your
Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the King knew that he had been deceived
by his courtiers, and he felt that he had
been very silly to believe them. He took Charming
with him to the palace right away, and, after
having the best supper which the cooks could
prepare served for Charming, the King asked
him to go and see whether it was not yet possible
to persuade Goldenlocks to marry him.</p>

<p>Charming did not set off with any such retinue
of servants as had the other ambassador. The
King gave him letters to the Princess, and
Charming picked out one present for her&mdash;a
lovely scarf embroidered with pearls.</p>

<p>The next morning Charming started out. He
had armed himself with a notebook and pencil.
As he rode along he thought much about what
he might say to the Princess that would make
her want to marry his King.</p>

<p>One day as he rode along he saw a deer
stretching out its neck to reach the leaves of the
tree above it. &ldquo;What a graceful creature!&rdquo;
thought Charming. &ldquo;I will tell Goldenlocks that
the King is as graceful as a deer.&rdquo; Then on
the road ahead he saw a great shadow, cast by
an eagle in its flight. &ldquo;How swift and strong
that eagle is,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I will tell the Princess
that the King is like the eagle in strength and
swiftness and majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming got off his horse and sat down by
a brook to jot down his thoughts in his notebook.
As he opened his book to write he saw,
struggling in the grass by his side, a golden
carp. The fish had jumped too high when it
tried to catch a fly, and had landed on the
ground. The poor creature was helpless to get
back into the water, and was gasping for breath;
fish, you know, cannot live long out of water.
Charming felt so sorry for the carp that he could
not write until he had put it carefully back into
the brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Charming,&rdquo; said a voice from the
water. Charming had never heard a fish speak
before, and you can imagine that he was mightily
surprised. &ldquo;Some day I will repay this kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several days after this adventure Charming
journeyed on. Then, one morning, he heard
a great crying in the air, above him. A huge vulture
was pursuing a raven. The vulture was
drawing closer and closer to its prey&mdash;was almost
upon it. Charming could not stand idly by and
watch the helpless little raven fight against its
enormous enemy. He drew his bow, and shot
an arrow straight into the vulture&#8217;s heart. The
raven flew down, and as it passed Charming it
said gratefully: &ldquo;I have you to thank that I am
not now in that great vulture&#8217;s beak. I will remember
your great kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long afterward, Charming came upon a
great net which men had stretched in the woods
in order to catch birds. A poor owl was caught
in it. &ldquo;Men are cruel creatures,&rdquo; thought Charming.
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think it is very kind or praiseworthy
to set a trap for these creatures who do
no one any harm.&rdquo; And Charming proceeded to
cut the net and set the owl free.</p>

<p>The owl flapped its wings noisily as it flew out
of the net. &ldquo;Thank you, Charming,&rdquo; it said.
&ldquo;You know I can&#8217;t see well in the daylight, and
I did not notice this trap. I shall never forget
that I have you to thank for my being alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming found Goldenlocks surrounded by a
splendor greater than any he had ever seen before.
Pearls and diamonds were so plentiful that
he began to think they must grow on trees in this
kingdom! It worried him a little, for he thought
he would have to be very clever to persuade
Goldenlocks to leave so much luxury.</p>

<p>With fear and trembling Charming presented
himself at the door of Princess Goldenlocks&#8217; palace
on the morning after his arrival. He had
dressed himself with the greatest care in a handsome
suit of crimson velvet. On his head was a
hat of the same brocaded material, trimmed with
waving ostrich plumes, which were fastened to
his hat with a clasp set with flashing diamonds.
A messenger was sent at once to the Princess to
announce his arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; the messenger said. &ldquo;There
is the most handsome gentleman sent from a King
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
awaiting you below. He is dressed like a Prince,
and he is the most charming person I have ever
seen. In fact, his very name is Charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name sounds as if I would like him,&rdquo;
said the Princess, musingly. &ldquo;I will see him
presently. Honora, bring me my best blue satin
gown&mdash;the one embroidered with pearls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Princess had a fresh wreath of pink
roses made to wind in her lovely golden hair;
Honora pushed tiny blue satin slippers on the
feet of her mistress, and handed her an exquisite
silver lace fan. Then Goldenlocks was all ready.
She assumed her most princess-like manner, and
entered the great throne room. You may be sure,
however, that she stopped on the way, in the hall
of mirrors, to see that she really deserved all the
compliments which her handmaids gave her.</p>

<p>When Goldenlocks was seated on the throne of
gold and ivory, and her handmaids were posed
gracefully about her, playing idly on guitars,
Charming was brought in. He was as though
struck dumb by the beauty which greeted his
eyes. He forgot for the moment all that he had
intended to say&mdash;all the long harangue prepared
so carefully on the way. Then he took a deep
breath, and began, just as he had intended, with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most lovely Princess Goldenlocks, I have come
to ask your hand in marriage for the most noble
King in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think his speech must have been very interesting,
for Goldenlocks did not take her eyes
from Charming&#8217;s face during the hour in which
Charming described the glories of his King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, O most gracious Princess, may I take
to the King as an answer to his plea?&rdquo; Charming
finally inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Goldenlocks kindly, &ldquo;I believe
that no King who was not worthy and charming
himself could have an ambassador like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added after a pause, &ldquo;tell him also
that Goldenlocks may not marry. I have taken a
solemn vow that I will not marry until a ring
which I lost in the brook a month ago is found.
I valued that ring more than my whole kingdom,
but it cannot be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming went away disheartened, because he
did not have the slightest idea how to go about
finding the Princess&#8217;s ring. Luckily for him, he
had brought with him a cunning little dog named
Frisk. Frisk was a light-hearted creature. He
always was hopeful. So he said to Charming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, master, let us not give up hope without
even trying. Let&#8217;s go down to the brook to-morrow
morning and see if we can&#8217;t find the
Princess&#8217;s bothersome ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, bright and early the next day, Charming
and Frisk walked slowly along the edge of the
brook which flowed near the palace, hunting for
the ring. They walked for about half an hour,
when a voice spoke to them out of nowhere:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Charming, I have kept my promise.
You once saved my life, you know. Now I have
brought you the Princess Goldenlocks&#8217; ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming looked up and down and all around
in great amazement. Then, at his very feet, he
saw the golden carp which he had rescued a few
days before; and, best of all, in the carp&#8217;s mouth
was the Princess&#8217;s gold ring.</p>

<p>With joy in his heart Charming rushed to the
palace, with Frisk dancing along at his heels.
Goldenlocks was disappointed to hear that he had
come back so soon. &ldquo;He must have given up
already,&rdquo; she told her handmaids, as she made
ready to receive Charming.</p>

<p>When Charming entered the Princess&#8217;s throne
room he did not say a word; he simply handed
her the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ring!&rdquo; the Princess called out in amazement.
&ldquo;You have found it!&rdquo; And she seemed
delighted that Charming had succeeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Charming, with something of assurance,
&ldquo;you will make ready to return to my
King with me, will you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; the Princess cried, as if she had
never thought of such a thing. &ldquo;I can never
marry until an awful enemy of mine is killed.
There is a fierce giant who lives near here. He
once asked me to marry him, and I, of course, refused.
It made him very angry. He swore vengeance
upon me, and I am afraid to leave my
kingdom while he is alive. I think the creature&mdash;his
name is Galifron&mdash;can really have no human
heart at all, for he can kill two or three or four
persons a day without feeling anything but joy
in his crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming shuddered at this appalling picture
of his enemy-to-be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be in my power so to do, Princess Goldenlocks,
I will slay your enemy.&rdquo; With these
words Charming turned on his heels and left the
palace.</p>

<p>Frisk realized that Charming was worried
about the difficult new task which Goldenlocks
had given him. &ldquo;Never you worry, Master,&rdquo; he
said cheerfully. &ldquo;If you will but attack the
monster I will bark and bite at his heels until
he won&#8217;t know what he is doing. He will be so
confused that I know you will be able to conquer
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming rode up to the giant&#8217;s castle boldly
enough. He knew the monster was coming
toward him, because he could hear the crash of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
trees which broke under the huge feet. Then
he heard a voice roaring like thunder:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Poof, woof, clear the way!</span><br />
 Bing, bang, &#8217;tis to-day!<br />
 Zip, zook, I must slay!<br />
 Whizz, fizz, the King&#8217;s pet, Charming!<br />
 Pish, tush, isn&#8217;t it alarming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming trembled, and he could feel the cold
perspiration stand out on his brow. But he took
a deep breath, and shouted as loud as he could
(which was not nearly as loud as the giant
could):</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Galifron, take warning,</span><br />
 For your day is ending.<br />
 Prepare to find that Charming<br />
 Is really quite alarming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Galifron was so high above Charming that
he had to hunt quite hard before he could discover
who was saying these words. When he
saw the little fellow standing ready to fight him
he laughed, and yet he was angry. He lifted his
great club and would have knocked the life out
of Charming in a trice, but suddenly he could
not see. He roared with pain, for a raven had
plucked out his eyes. Galifron beat wildly in the
air, trying to protect himself from the bird; meanwhile
Charming seized his opportunity, and it was
only a moment until Galifron lay at Charming&#8217;s
feet. Only Galifron was so big that Charming
had to stand on top of him in order to make sure
that he was really dead.</p>

<p>To the Princess, Charming rode back as fast
as his horse could carry him. In front of him,
on his saddle, he carried the giant&#8217;s head. The
Princess was taking her afternoon nap, when she
was awakened by loud shouts of &ldquo;Hail, Charming!
Hail, conqueror of hideous Galifron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goldenlocks could scarcely believe her ears.
She rushed to the front of the palace, and sure
enough, there she was greeted by Charming, bearing
her enemy&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>It seemed as if such a feat of daring should
have been enough to satisfy even Goldenlocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fair Princess, will you not return with
me to my King?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming, I cannot,&rdquo; said the Princess; and
to Charming her words sounded like the stroke
of doom. &ldquo;Before I marry I must have some
water from the spring of eternal youth. This
spring is at the bottom of Gloomy Cavern&mdash;a
great cave not far from here, which is guarded
by two fierce dragons. If I have a flask from
that spring I shall always remain young and
beautiful. I should never dare to marry without
its protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful Goldenlocks, you could never be
anything but young and beautiful; but I will none
the less try to fulfill your mission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though Charming had just conquered a
giant he did not feel very comfortable at the
idea of having to find his way past two dragons
into a dark and gloomy cavern. He approached
the cavern with much determination, but with
many misgivings. When Frisk saw the black
smoke belching out of the rocks at the entrance
of the cavern the dog shook all over with fear;
and I have been told that when Charming saw
Frisk run off and try to hide, he himself would
have been very glad if he could have run away,
too. But being a man, he, of course, had to be
brave; so he set his teeth and approached the
cave.</p>

<p>Then he saw the first dragon&mdash;a huge, slimy
creature, all yellow and green, with great red
claws, and a tail which seemed to Charming to
be nearly a mile long.</p>

<p>Charming turned back and called to Frisk.
&ldquo;Dear Frisk,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I know I shall
never see the light of day again if I enter this
cavern. Wait here for me until nightfall; then,
if I have not come back, go and tell the Princess
that I have lost my life trying to win for her
eternal youth and beauty. Then tell the King
that I did my best for him, but failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming turned again to attack the dragon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Charming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charming looked around to see who spoke
these words. &ldquo;It&#8217;s I, Charming, the owl you
rescued from the net the fowlers set for us poor
birds. Let me take Goldenlocks&#8217; flask, and I will
fetch the water for you. I know every turn of
that dark cavern, and the dragons will not notice
whether I pass them or not.&rdquo; And the owl took
the flask out of Charming&#8217;s hand, fluttered into
the cavern, and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Charming. You see I did not
forget your kindness to me.&rdquo; With these words
the owl handed to Charming the flask full of
water from the magic spring. Charming was so
happy that he could hardly find words to thank
the owl. He rode straight to Goldenlocks with
the wonderful liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful Goldenlocks, here is the water you
asked me to get for you. My mind cannot conceive
of anything, however, which would add to
your beauty. I do know, however, something
which would add to your happiness. I have
found your ring, slain your enemy, brought you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the secret of youth and health; now will you not
come with me to my King, who loves you so
much that he will make you the happiest woman
on earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Goldenlocks, softly. Her answer
really surprised Charming very much, because he
had come to think that she would never cease to
find new tasks for him to perform. She gave
orders at once for the necessary preparations for
the journey, and in a few days she and Charming
and little Frisk set out for home, with a great
retinue of servants, of course.</p>

<p>The King greeted them with the greatest enthusiasm.
He proclaimed a holiday throughout
his kingdom, and every one feasted and danced.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, the Princess Goldenlocks
found herself daily thinking more and more, not
of the King, but of Charming.</p>

<p>One day Charming found himself once more
in prison, bound hand and foot. The King
thought this would be a good way to rid himself
of his rival.</p>

<p>Goldenlocks used to beg the King to set Charming
free, but that only made things worse. Little
Frisk was Charming&#8217;s only comfort; he used
to take him all the court news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said the King to himself one day,
&ldquo;the reason Goldenlocks prefers Charming to me
is that I am not beautiful enough to suit her. I
believe I will try some of that water of eternal
beauty and health that she is always talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word to anyone the King stole into
the Queen&#8217;s room and hunted about until he found
the flask of water. He bathed his face in the
water and stood in front of a mirror to watch
the change. A few hours later the Queen found
him sound asleep. She could not awaken him,
and they sent for the court physician; he could
not rouse the King. &ldquo;The King,&rdquo; the physician
told the Queen, &ldquo;is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this is what had happened. One day
when the Princess&#8217;s maid Honora was cleaning
her room she knocked over the flask which contained
the precious water, and broke it in a
thousand pieces. Honora was terribly frightened.
She would not have let the Princess know
what had occurred for anything. She remembered
seeing a flask in the King&#8217;s room just like
the one she had broken, and she put it in the
very spot from which she had knocked the other.</p>

<p>Unluckily for the King, the maid took a flask
which contained a deadly water which was used
to &ldquo;do away&rdquo; with criminals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woof, woof!&rdquo; said Frisk in the Queen&#8217;s ear.
&ldquo;Please have pity on my poor master, good
Queen! Remember all he did for you, and how
he is suffering for your sake now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goldenlocks at once left the room where the
King&#8217;s body lay in state and went to the tower
where Charming was confined. She opened his
cell and set him free. She put a golden crown on
his head, and removed the chains from his wrists
and ankles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Charming!&rdquo; said the Queen, &ldquo;now you
and I shall be married, and&mdash;live happily ever
after!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="PRINCE" id="PRINCE"></a>PRINCE HYACINTH<br />
AND THE DEAR LITTLE PRINCESS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MADAME LEPRINCE DE BEAUMONT</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a King who was
deeply in love with a Princess, but she could
not marry anyone, because she was under an enchantment.
So the King set out to seek a fairy,
and asked what he could do to win the Princess&#8217;s
love. The Fairy said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that the Princess has a great cat
which she is very fond of. Whoever is clever
enough to tread on that cat&#8217;s tail is the man she is
destined to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King said to himself that this would not
be very difficult; and he left the Fairy, determined
to grind the cat&#8217;s tail to powder rather
than not tread on it at all.</p>

<p>You may imagine that it was not long before
he went to see the Princess; and puss, as usual,
marched in before him, arching its back. The
King took a long step, and quite thought he had
the tail under his foot, but the cat turned round
so sharply that he trod only on air. And so it
went on for eight days, till the King began to
think that this fatal tail must be full of quick-silver&mdash;it
was never still for a moment.</p>

<p>At last, however, he was lucky enough to come
upon puss fast asleep and with its tail conveniently
spread out. So the King, without losing
a moment, set his foot upon it heavily.</p>

<p>With one terrific yell the cat sprang up and
instantly changed into a tall man, who, fixing
his angry eyes upon the King, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall marry the Princess because you
have been able to break the enchantment, but I
will have my revenge. You shall have a son,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
who will never be happy until he finds out that
his nose is too long, and if you ever tell anyone
what I have just said to you, you shall vanish
away instantly, and no one shall ever see you
or hear of you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the King was horribly afraid of the
enchanter, he could not help laughing at this
threat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my son has such a long nose as that,&rdquo; he
said to himself, &ldquo;he must always see it or feel
it; at least, if he is not blind or without hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as the enchanter had vanished, he did not
waste any more time in thinking, but went to
seek the Princess, who very soon consented to
marry him. But after all, they had not been
married very long when the King died, and the
Queen had nothing left to care for but her little
son, who was called Hyacinth. The little Prince
had large blue eyes, the prettiest eyes in the
world, and a sweet little mouth, but, alas! his
nose was so enormous that it covered half his
face. The Queen was inconsolable when she saw
this great nose, but her ladies assured her that
it was not really as large as it looked; that it was
a Roman nose, and you had only to open any
history book to see that every hero has a large nose.
The Queen, who was devoted to her baby, was
pleased with what they told her, and when she
looked at Hyacinth again, his nose certainly did
not seem to her <em>quite</em> so large.</p>

<p>The Prince was brought up with great care;
and, as soon as he could speak, they told him all
sorts of dreadful stories about people who had
short noses. No one was allowed to come near
him whose nose did not more or less resemble
his own, and the courtiers, to get into favor
with the Queen, took to pulling their babies&#8217;
noses several times every day to make them grow
long. But, do what they would, they were nothing
by comparison with the Prince&#8217;s.</p>

<p>When he grew older he learned history; and
whenever any great prince or beautiful princess
was spoken of, his teachers took care to tell him
that they had long noses.</p>

<p>His room was hung with pictures, all of people
with very large noses; and the Prince grew up
so convinced that a long nose was a great beauty
that he would not on any account have had his
own a single inch shorter!</p>

<p>When his twentieth birthday was past, the
Queen thought it was time that he should be
married, so she commanded that the portraits of
several princesses should be brought for him to
see, and among the others was a picture of the
Dear Little Princess!</p>

<p>Now, she was the daughter of a great King,
and would some day possess several kingdoms
herself; but Prince Hyacinth had not a thought
to spare for anything of that sort, he was so
much struck with her beauty. The Princess, whom
he thought quite charming, had, however, a little
saucy nose, which, in her face, was the prettiest
thing possible, but it was a cause of great
embarrassment to the courtiers, who had got into
such a habit of laughing at little noses that they
sometimes found themselves laughing at hers before
they had time to think; but this did not do
at all before the Prince, who quite failed to see
the joke, and actually banished two of his courtiers
who had dared to mention disrespectfully the
Dear Little Princess&#8217;s tiny nose!</p>

<p>The others, taking warning from this, learned
to think twice before they spoke, and one even
went so far as to tell the Prince that, though it
was quite true that no man could be worth anything
unless he had a long nose, still, a woman&#8217;s
beauty was a different thing, and he knew a
learned man who understood Greek and had read
in some old manuscripts that the beautiful Cleopatra
herself had a &ldquo;tip-tilted&rdquo; nose!</p>

<p>The Prince made him a splendid present as a
reward for this good news, and at once sent
ambassadors to ask the Dear Little Princess in
marriage. The King, her father, gave his consent;
and Prince Hyacinth, who, in his anxiety
to see the Princess, had gone three leagues to
meet her, was just advancing to kiss her hand
when, to the horror of all who stood by, the enchanter
appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning,
and, snatching up the Dear Little Princess,
whirled her away out of their sight!</p>

<p>The Prince was left quite inconsolable, and declared
that nothing should induce him to go back
to his kingdom until he had found her again,
and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to
follow him, he mounted his horse and rode sadly
away, letting the animal choose its own path.</p>

<p>So it happened that he came presently to a great
plain, across which he rode all day long without
seeing a single house, and horse and rider were
terribly hungry, when, as the night fell, the Prince
caught sight of a light.</p>

<p>He rode up to it, and saw a little old woman,
who appeared to be at least a hundred years old.</p>

<p>She put on her spectacles to look at Prince
Hyacinth, but it was quite a long time before
she could fix them securely, because her nose was
so very short.</p>

<p>The Prince and the Fairy (for that was who
she was) had no sooner looked at one another
than they went into fits of laughter, and cried
at the same moment, &ldquo;Oh, what a funny nose!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so funny as your own,&rdquo; said Prince Hyacinth
to the Fairy; &ldquo;but, madam, I beg you to
leave the consideration of our noses&mdash;such as they
are&mdash;and to be good enough to give me something
to eat, for I am starving, and so is my
poor horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; said the Fairy. &ldquo;Though
your nose is so ridiculous, you are, nevertheless,
the son of my best friend. I loved your father
as if he had been my brother. Now <em>he</em> had a
very handsome nose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray, what does mine lack?&rdquo; said the
Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it doesn&#8217;t <em>lack anything</em>,&rdquo; replied the
Fairy. &ldquo;On the contrary quite, there is only too
much of it. But never mind, one may be a very
worthy man though his nose is too long. I was
telling you that I was your father&#8217;s friend; he
often came to see me in the old times, and you
must know that I was very pretty in those days;
at least, he used to say so. I should like to tell
you of a conversation we had the last time I
ever saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;when I have supped
it will give me the greatest pleasure to hear it;
but consider, madam, I beg of you, that I have
had nothing to eat to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor boy is right,&rdquo; said the Fairy; &ldquo;I
was forgetting. Come in, then, and I will give
you some supper, and while you are eating I can
tell you my story in a very few words&mdash;for I
don&#8217;t like endless tales myself. Too long a tongue
is worse than too long a nose, and I remember
when I was young that I was so much admired
for not being a great chatterer. They used to tell
the Queen, my mother, that it was so. For though
you see what I am now, I was the daughter of
a great king. My father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father, I dare say, got something to eat
when he was hungry!&rdquo; interrupted the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; answered the Fairy, &ldquo;and you
also shall have supper directly. I only just
wanted to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I really cannot listen to anything until I
have had something to eat,&rdquo; cried the Prince,
who was getting quite angry; but then, remembering
that he had better be polite as he much
needed the Fairy&#8217;s help, he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that in the pleasure of listening to you
I should quite forget my own hunger; but my
horse, who cannot hear you, must really be fed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fairy was very much flattered by this compliment,
and said, calling to her servants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not wait another minute, you are
so polite, and in spite of the enormous size of
your nose you are really very agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plague take the old lady! How she does go
on about my nose!&rdquo; said the Prince to himself.
&ldquo;One would almost think that mine had taken
all the extra length that hers lacks! If I were
not so hungry I would soon have done with this
chatterpie who thinks she talks very little! How
stupid people are not to see their own faults!
That comes of being a princess; she has been
spoilt by flatterers, who have made her believe
that she is quite a moderate talker!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the servants were putting the supper
on the table, and the Prince was much amused
to hear the Fairy, who asked them a thousand
questions simply for the pleasure of hearing herself
speak; especially he noticed one maid who,
no matter what was being said, always contrived
to praise her mistress&#8217;s wisdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he thought, as he ate his supper. &ldquo;I&#8217;m
very glad I came here. This just shows me how
sensible I have been in never listening to flatterers.
People of that sort praise us to our faces
without shame, and hide our faults or change
them into virtues. For my part I never will be
taken in by them. I know my own defects, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Prince Hyacinth! He really believed what
he said, and hadn&#8217;t an idea that the people who
had praised his nose were laughing at him, just as
the Fairy&#8217;s maid was laughing at her; for the
Prince had seen her laugh slyly when she could
do so without the Fairy&#8217;s noticing her.</p>

<p>However, he said nothing, and presently, when
his hunger began to be appeased, the Fairy said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Prince, might I beg you to move a
little more that way, for your nose casts such
a shadow that I really cannot see what I have on
my plate. Ah! thanks. Now let us speak of your
father. When I went to his Court he was only
a little boy, but that is forty years ago, and I have
been in this desolate place ever since. Tell me
what goes on nowadays; are the ladies as fond of
amusement as ever? In my time one saw them
at parties, theaters, balls, and promenades every
day. Dear me! <em>What</em> a long nose you have! I
cannot get used to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, madam,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I wish you
would leave off mentioning my nose. It cannot
matter to you what it is like. I am quite satisfied
with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One
must take what is given one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are angry with me, my poor Hyacinth,&rdquo;
said the Fairy, &ldquo;and I assure you that I
didn&#8217;t mean to vex you; on the contrary, I wished
to do you a service. However, though I really
cannot help your nose being a shock to me, I will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
try not to say anything about it. I will even try
to think that you have an ordinary nose. To tell
the truth, it would make three reasonable ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince, who was no longer hungry, grew
so impatient at the Fairy&#8217;s continual remarks
about his nose that at last he threw himself upon
his horse and rode hastily away. But wherever
he came in his journey he thought the people were
mad, for they all talked of his nose, and yet he
could not bring himself to admit that it was too
long, he had been so used all his life to hear it
called handsome.</p>

<p>The old Fairy, who wished to make him happy,
at last hit upon a plan. She shut the Dear Little
Princess up in a palace of crystal, and put this
palace down where the Prince could not fail to
find it. His joy at seeing the Princess again was
extreme, and he set to work with all his might
to try to break her prison, but in spite of all his
efforts he failed utterly. In despair he thought at
least that he would try to get near enough to speak
to the Dear Little Princess, who, on her part,
stretched out her hand that he might kiss it; but
turn which way he might, he never could raise it
to his lips, for his long nose always prevented it.
For the first time he realized how long it really
was, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be admitted that my nose <em>is</em> too
long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant the crystal prison flew into a
thousand splinters, and the old Fairy, taking the
Dear Little Princess by the hand, said to the
Prince:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, say if you are not very much obliged
to me. Much good it was for me to talk to you
about your nose! You would never have found
out how extraordinary it was if it hadn&#8217;t hindered
you from doing what you wanted to. You
see how self-love keeps us from knowing our
own defects of mind and body. Our reason tries
in vain to show them to us; we refuse to see
them till we find them in our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Hyacinth, whose nose was now just
like anyone else&#8217;s, did not fail to profit by
the lesson he had received. He married the
Dear Little Princess, and they lived happily
ever after.</p>

<h2><a name="CINDERELLA" id="CINDERELLA"></a>CINDERELLA</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY CHARLES PERRAULT</strong></p>


<p>Once there was a gentleman who married,
for his second wife, the proudest and most
haughty woman that was ever seen. She had,
by a former husband, two daughters of her
own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in
all things. He had likewise, by his first wife, a
young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and
sweetness of temper, which she took from her
mother, who was the best creature in the world.</p>

<p>No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding
over but the step-mother began to show herself
in her true colors. She could not bear the good
qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because
they made her own daughters appear the more
odious. She employed her in the meanest work
of the house: the young girl scoured the dishes,
tables, etc., and scrubbed madam&#8217;s chamber, and
those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a
sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while
her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid,
upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where
they had looking glasses so large that they might
see themselves at their full length from head to
foot.</p>

<p>The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not
tell her father, who would have rattled her off;
for his wife governed him entirely. When she
had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner,
and sit down among cinders and ashes,
which made her commonly be called <em>Cinderwench</em>;
but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil
as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However,
Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel,
was a hundred times handsomer than her
sisters, though they were always dressed very
richly.</p>

<p>It happened that the King&#8217;s son gave a ball,
and invited all persons of fashion to it. Our
young misses were also invited, for they cut a
very grand figure among the quality. They were
mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully
busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats,
and head-clothes as might become them. This
was a new trouble to Cinderella; for it was she
who ironed her sister&#8217;s linen, and plaited their
ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but
how they should be dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said the eldest, &ldquo;I will wear my
red velvet suit with French trimming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the youngest, &ldquo;shall have my
usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that,
I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my
diamond stomacher, which is far from being
the most ordinary one in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sent for the best tire-woman they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
get to dress their hair and to adjust their double
pinners.</p>

<p>Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be
consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent
notions, and advised them always for the
best, nay, and offered her services to dress their
heads, which they were very willing she should
do. As she was doing this, they said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the
ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you only jeer at me; it is
not for such as I am to go thither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art in the right of it,&rdquo; replied they; &ldquo;it
would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench
at a ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their
heads awry, but she was very good, and did them
perfectly well. They were almost two days without
eating, so much they were transported with
joy. They broke above a dozen of laces in trying
to be laced up close, that they might have a
fine slender shape, and they were continually at
their looking-glasses. At last the happy day came;
they went to Court, and Cinderella followed them
with her eyes as long as she could, and when she
had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.</p>

<p>Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked
her what was the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could&mdash;I wish I could&mdash;&rdquo; she was
not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by
her tears and sobbing.</p>

<p>This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said
to her, &ldquo;Thou wishest thou couldst go to the ball;
is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;es,&rdquo; cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her godmother, &ldquo;be but a good
girl, and I will contrive that thou shalt go.&rdquo; Then
she took her into her chamber, and said to her,
&ldquo;Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella went immediately to gather the
finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother,
not being able to imagine how this pumpkin
could make her go to the ball. Her godmother
scooped out all the inside of it, having
left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck
it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly
turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with
gold.</p>

<p>She then went to look into the mouse-trap,
where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered
Cinderella to lift up a little the trap-door, when,
giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap
with her wand, the mouse was that moment
turned into a fine horse, which altogether made
a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored
dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a coachman,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and see,&rdquo; says Cinderella, &ldquo;if there
should be a rat in the rat-trap&mdash;we may make a
coachman of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art in the right,&rdquo; replied her godmother;
&ldquo;go and look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella brought the trap to her and in it
there were three huge rats. The fairy made
choice of one of the three which had the largest
beard, and, having touched him with her wand,
he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who
had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.
After that, she said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go again into the garden, and you will find
six lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had no sooner done so than her godmother
turned them into six footmen, who skipped up
immediately behind the coach, with their liveries
all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as
close behind each other as if they had done nothing
else their whole lives. The Fairy then said
to Cinderella:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to
the ball with; are you not pleased with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; cried she; &ldquo;but must I go thither
as I am, in these nasty rags?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her godmother only just touched her with her
wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were
turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset
with jewels. This done, she gave her a pair
of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.
Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach;
but her godmother, above all things, commanded
her not to stay till after midnight, telling her,
at the same time, that if she stayed one moment
longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her
horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen
lizards, and her clothes become just as they were
before.</p>

<p>She promised her godmother she would not
fail of leaving the ball before midnight; and then
away she drove, scarce able to contain herself
for joy. The King&#8217;s son, who was told that a
great princess, whom nobody knew, was come,
ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she
alighted out of the coach, and led her into the
hall, among all the company. There was immediately
a profound silence, they left off dancing
and the violins ceased to play, so attentive
was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties
of the unknown new-comer. Nothing was
then heard but a confused noise of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! how handsome she is! Ah! how handsome
she is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King himself, old as he was, could not
help watching her, and telling the Queen softly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
that it was a long time since he had seen so
beautiful and lovely a creature.</p>

<p>All the ladies were busied in considering her
clothes and head-dress, that they might have
some made next day after the same pattern,
provided they could meet with such fine materials
and as able hands to make them.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s son conducted her to the most
honorable seat, and afterward took her out to
dance with him; she danced so very gracefully
that they all more and more admired her. A fine
collation was served up, whereof the young Prince
ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in
gazing on her.</p>

<p>She went and sat down by her sisters, showing
them a thousand civilities, giving them part
of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had
presented her with, which very much surprised
them, for they did not know her. While Cinderella
was thus amusing her sisters, she heard
the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon
she immediately made a courtesy to the
company and hastened away as fast as she could.</p>

<p>Arrived at home, she ran to seek out her godmother,
and, after having thanked her, she said
she could not but heartily wish she might go next
day to the ball, because the King&#8217;s son had
desired her.</p>

<p>As she was eagerly telling her godmother
whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters
knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and
opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long you have stayed!&rdquo; cried she, gaping,
rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as
if she had been just waked out of her sleep;
she had not, however, any manner of inclination
to sleep since they went from home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thou hadst been at the ball,&rdquo; says one of
her sisters, &ldquo;thou wouldst not have been tired
with it. There came thither the finest princess,
the most beautiful ever seen with mortal eyes;
she showed us a thousand civilities, and gave
us oranges and citrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter.
She did ask them the name of that princess;
but they told her they did not know it, and that
the King&#8217;s son was very uneasy on her account
and would give all the world to know who she
was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how
happy you have been! Could not I see her? Ah!
dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow
suit of clothes which you wear every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be sure!&rdquo; cried Miss Charlotte; &ldquo;lend
my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as thou
art! I should be a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella, indeed, expected well such an answer,
and was very glad of the refusal; for she
would have been sadly put to it if her sister had
lent her what she asked for jestingly.</p>

<p>The next day the two sisters were at the ball,
and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently
than before. The King&#8217;s son was always
by her, and never ceased his compliments and
kind speeches to her. All this was so far from
being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
godmother had recommended to her; so that she,
at last, counted the clock striking twelve when
she took it to be no more than eleven. She then
rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince
followed, but could not overtake her. She left
behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince
took up most carefully. She got home, but quite
out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having
nothing left her of all her finery but one of the
little slippers, fellow to that she dropped.</p>

<p>The guards at the palace gate were asked if
they had not seen a princess go out. To this they
replied that they had seen nobody go out but a
young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had
more the air of a poor country wench than a
gentlewoman.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/img22.jpg" width="247" height="330" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>When the two sisters returned from the ball
Cinderella asked them whether they had had a
good time, and if the fine lady had been there.</p>

<p>They told her: &ldquo;Yes, but she hurried away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
immediately when it struck twelve, and with so
much haste that she dropped one of her little
glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which
the King&#8217;s son picked up; he did nothing but
look at her all the time at the ball, and most
certainly he is very much in love with the beautiful
person who owned the glass slipper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What they said was very true; for a few days
after the King&#8217;s son caused it to be proclaimed,
by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her
whose foot this slipper would just fit. They
whom he employed began to try it upon the
princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court,
but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters,
who did all they possibly could to thrust their
foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.
Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper,
said to them, laughing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see if it will not fit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began
to banter her. The gentleman who was sent to
try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and,
finding her very handsome, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is but just that she should try, and I have
orders to let everyone make trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting
the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very
easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of
wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in
was excessively great, but still abundantly greater
when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the
other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon,
in came her godmother, who, having touched
with her wand Cinderella&#8217;s clothes, made them
richer and more magnificent than any of those
she had before.</p>

<p>And now her two sisters found her to be that
fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the
ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg
pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made
her undergo. Cinderella took them up, and, as
she embraced them, cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgive you with all my heart, and I want
you to love me always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was conducted to the young Prince, dressed
as she was; he thought her more charming than
ever, and, a few days after, married her. Cinderella,
who was no less good than beautiful,
gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and
that very same day matched them with two great
lords of the Court.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SLEEPING" id="SLEEPING"></a>THE SLEEPING BEAUTY</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>ADAPTED FROM THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>The King and Queen of a faraway country
once had a little daughter, who was more beautiful
than any child that had ever before been
seen. Her father and mother were so delighted
that they proclaimed a public holiday on her
christening, and invited to act as godmothers the
seven good fairies who lived in the kingdom.
Unfortunately, they forgot to ask one ugly old
fairy, who had remained shut up in her tower so
many years that people really had forgotten about
her.</p>

<p>When the night of the christening arrived the
castle was beautiful to behold. Lights shone
even to the highest tower; beautiful music sounded
from behind masses of fragrant flowers;
splendidly dressed knights and ladies were there
to honor the little Princess; and the seven good
fairies smilingly gave her their gifts.</p>

<p>So excited and happy were all that no one
noticed an old creature who had slipped in and
stood in the shadow looking on. This was the
fairy who had not been invited; and, in anger at
the slight, she was waiting her chance to make
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my gift,&rdquo; said the first fairy, &ldquo;I grant
that the Princess shall be the most beautiful
person in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give her the mind of an angel,&rdquo; said the
second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall be grace itself,&rdquo; said the third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall dance like a goddess,&rdquo; said the
fourth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her voice shall equal the nightingale&#8217;s,&rdquo; said
the fifth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The art of playing on all musical instruments
shall be hers,&rdquo; said the sixth.</p>

<p>Now the wicked old enchantress thought that
all seven good fairies had spoken, so she stepped
forth, her face distorted with hatred and envy,
and said: &ldquo;So I am not thought good enough
to be a guest here: you despise me because I
am old and ugly. I shall make a gift, and it
shall be a curse. When your fine young lady
becomes sixteen she shall fall asleep, and nothing
you can do will be able to waken her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with a horrid laugh the hag disappeared.</p>

<p>Horror seized the guests, and the party, which
had been so gay, became solemn indeed.</p>

<p>Then the seventh good fairy sprang up and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
said in silvery tones: &ldquo;My gift is yet to be laid
before the Princess. I am young, and I can not
undo the evil that has befallen. But be not unhappy,
for I grant that on the day when the
curse falls, every living thing in the castle shall
also fall asleep. Moreover, I grant that whenever
there is a Prince who is brave enough to
be worthy of this lovely Princess, he shall find
a way to break the spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the little girl grew older the words of the
good fairies came true. Not only was she beautiful
and gifted, but she was so kind and thoughtful
that everyone loved her dearly.</p>

<p>At first they were very careful to tell her
nothing of the wicked fairy&#8217;s curse, and then there
were so many other things to think about that
people forgot all about the old fairy and her gift.</p>

<p>The sixteenth birthday arrived, and there was
a very special celebration to please the Princess.
The castle was decorated more beautifully, if possible,
than on the night of the christening, and
everyone was dancing or laughing and as happy
as could be. Suddenly the old fairy stepped out
from a shadow, as she had done years before,
and looking at the beautiful girl said, &ldquo;Sleep.&rdquo;
Immediately not one sound or stir was in that
gorgeous castle.</p>

<p>Now, you must forget for a bit all about the
Sleeping Beauty, and hear about a noble Prince
who was born many years later in a kingdom
not far from this one. Not only was this Prince
handsome and brave, but he was so kind and
good that people called him &ldquo;Prince Winsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All his life he had heard terrible stories about
an enchanted castle, whose towers could be seen
on a clear day far off above a dense forest. It
was said that the trees grew so close together in
this forest that when a knight attempted to force
his way through, he always became entangled
in the branches and perished. Many young men
were said to have met this fate; so little by little
people stopped trying to reach the castle.</p>

<p>But the little Prince was courageous. &ldquo;When
I am sixteen, I shall start out for the magic
forest and rescue the beautiful maiden, whom,
I am sure, I shall find in the castle,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>True to his word, on his sixteenth birthday our
Prince set off eagerly on his adventure. His courtiers
urged him not to go, and his subjects pleaded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with him, for they did not wish to lose their
Prince. They were afraid he would die in the
forest they so dreaded. They did not realize how
difficulties and dangers give way before a brave,
true-hearted youth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">the sleeping beauty<br />

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Prince Winsome reached the edge of the
dense forest it looked as if no man could ever
enter. Great trees grew close together with their
branches intertwined. So thick were they that
the place looked as dark as night. When Winsome
came near, a marvelous thing happened.
The branches slowly untwined and the trees
seemed to bend apart and make a narrow pathway
for his entrance. They closed immediately
after him, so that his followers were closed out
and he went on alone. After a long time he
found himself in the courtyard of a great
castle. There was not a sound or a stir; the
watchman stood sleeping at the gate, and the
guards were standing as if playing a game of dice,
but all were sound asleep.</p>

<p>Prince Winsome entered the castle hall and
found it full of noble ladies and knights, servants,
waiting maids, flower girls, all motionless and yet
the flush of life on their cheeks. The dancers
seemed about to whirl away in the waltz; the musicians
bent over their violins; and a servant was
in the act of passing cakes to the guests&mdash;yet they
all held the same fixed position, and had since that
day years before when sleep overcame them.</p>

<p>Advancing from room to room the same sight
everywhere met our hero&#8217;s eyes, but his heart began
to beat faster and faster, and he knew that
the object of his search was near. At last he
entered the throne room and there on an ivory
throne, her head resting against a satin pillow,
was his longed-for Princess. She was so much
more beautiful than he had even imagined that he
paused in rapture; then, crossing to her, he knelt
by her side and kissed her tenderly on the brow.</p>

<p>Then what do you think happened? The Princess
smiled, drew a long breath, opened her eyes
slowly, and said: &ldquo;Oh, my Prince! I knew you
would come.&rdquo; At the same moment the musicians
went on just where they had stopped playing so
many years before; the dancers finished their
waltz; the servant offered the cakes; and no one
but the Prince seemed to think the proceeding
strange at all.</p>

<p>The Sleeping Beauty and Prince Winsome were
married at once, and lived long and happily.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BEAUTY" id="BEAUTY"></a>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h2>


<p>There was once a merchant who was extremely
rich. He had six children&mdash;three boys and three
girls; and as he was a very sensible man, he
spared nothing on their education, but gave them
all kinds of masters. His daughters were beautiful,
but the youngest had such a peculiar charm
about her that even from her birth she had been
called Beauty; and this name caused her sisters to
feel jealous and envious of her. The reason she
was so much more admired than they were, was
that she was much more amiable. Her sweet face
beamed with good temper and cheerfulness. No
frown ever spoiled her fair brow, or bowed the
corners of her mouth. She possessed the charm
of good temper, which is in itself beauty.</p>

<p>The merchant&#8217;s elder daughters were idle, ill-tempered,
and proud; therefore people soon forgot
that they were beautiful, and only remembered
them as very disagreeable.</p>

<p>The pride of these young ladies was so great
that they did not care to visit the daughters of
men in their father&#8217;s own rank of life, but wished
to be the friends of great ladies and princesses.</p>

<p>They were always busy trying to get great
acquaintances, and met with many mortifications
in the effort; however, it pleased them to go out
and endeavor to be people of fashion. Every day
they drove in the parks, and went in the evening
to balls, operas, and plays.</p>

<p>Meantime, Beauty spent almost all her days
in studying. Her recreation was to do good. She
was to be found in every poor cottage where there
was trouble or sickness, and the poor loved her
as much as the rich admired her. As it was
known that their father was very rich, many merchants
asked the girls in marriage; but all these
offers were refused, because the two eldest thought
they ought at least to be wives of a rich nobleman
or a prince.</p>

<p>As for Beauty, she thanked those who asked
her to share their fortunes, but told them that
she was too young; that she wished to be her
father&#8217;s companion, and cheer his old age by her
loving care.</p>

<p>One unhappy day the merchant returned home
in the evening, and told them that he was ruined;
that his ships had gone down at sea, and that the
firms with which he had been dealing were bankrupt.</p>

<p>Beauty wept for grief, because her father was
unhappy and unfortunate, and asked him what
was to be done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my child,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we must give up
our house, and go into the country. There I can
get a cottage to shelter us; and we must live by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the work of our own hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Beauty eagerly, &ldquo;I can spin and
knit, and sew very well. I dare say I shall be
able to help you, my dear father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the elder daughters did not speak. They
had made up their minds to marry one or the
other of their rejected lovers, and did not intend
to share their father&#8217;s fallen fortunes.</p>

<p>They found themselves, however, greatly mistaken.
The merchants who had wished to marry
them when rich cared nothing for them when
poor, and never came to see them again. But
those who had loved Beauty crowded to the house,
and begged and besought her to marry them and
share their fortunes. Beauty was grateful, but
she told them that she could not leave her father
in his sorrow; she must go with him to console
him and work for him. The poor girl was very
sorry to lose her fortune, because she could not
do so much good without it; but she knew that
her place was ordered for her, and that she might
be quite as happy poor as rich.</p>

<p>Very soon the merchant&#8217;s family had to leave
their noble mansion, to sell off all their costly
furniture, and to go into the country, where the
father and his sons got work; the former as
a bailiff, the latter as farm laborers. And now
Beauty had to think and work for all.</p>

<p>She rose at four o&#8217;clock every morning. She
cleaned the house; prepared the breakfast; spread
it neatly, and decked the board with the sweetest
flowers. Then she cooked the dinner, and when
evening came and brought the laborers home,
Beauty had always a cheerful welcome for them,
a clean home, and a savory supper. During the
hours of the afternoon she used to read and keep
up her knowledge of languages; and all the time
she worked she sang like a bird. Her taste made
their poor home look nice, even elegant.</p>

<p>She was happy in doing her duty. Her early
rising revealed to her a thousand beauties in nature
of which she had never before dreamed.</p>

<p>Beauty acknowledged to herself that sunrise
was finer than any picture she had ever seen;
that no perfumes equalled those of the flowers;
that no opera gave her so much enjoyment as the
song of the lark and the serenade of the nightingale.</p>

<p>Her sleep was as happy and peaceful as that
of a child; her awakening, cheerful, contented,
and blest by heaven.</p>

<p>Meantime her sisters grew peevish, cross, and
miserable. They would not work, and as they
had nothing else to amuse them, the days dragged
along, and seemed as if they would never end.
They did nothing but regret the past and bewail
the present. As they had no one to admire them,
they did not care how they looked, and were as
dirty and neglected in appearance as Beauty was
neat and fresh and charming.</p>

<p>Perhaps they had some consciousness of the
contrast between her and themselves, for they disliked
the poor girl more than ever, and were always
mocking her, and jesting about her wonderful
fitness for being a servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite plain,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;that you
are just where you ought to be: We are ladies;
but you are a low-minded girl, who have found
your right place in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beauty only answered her sisters&#8217; unkind words
with soft and tender ones, so there was no quarrelling,
and by-and-by they became ashamed to
speak to her harshly.</p>

<p>At the expiration of a year the merchant received
intelligence of the arrival of one of his
richest ships, which had escaped the storm. He
prepared to set off to a distant port to claim his
property; but before he went he asked each daughter
what gift he should bring back for her. The
eldest wished for pearls; the second for diamonds;
but the third said, &ldquo;Dear father, bring me a white
rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it is no easy task to find a white rose in
that country, yet, as Beauty was his kindest
daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her
father said he would try what he could do. So
he kissed all three, and bade them good-by. And
when the time came for him to go home, he had
bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but
he had sought everywhere in vain for the white
rose; and when he went into any garden and asked
for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and
asked him who had ever heard of a white rose.
This grieved him very much, for his third daughter
was his dearest child; and as he was journeying
home, thinking what he should bring her, he
lost his way in a wood. The night was closing
in, and as the merchant was aware that there
were many bears in that country, he became very
anxious to find a shelter for the night.</p>

<p>By-and-by he perceived afar off a light, which
appeared to come from a human dwelling, and he
urged on his tired horse till he gained the spot.
Instead of the woodman&#8217;s hut on a hill which he
had expected to see, he found himself in front of
a magnificent castle, built of white marble. Approaching
the door, he blew a golden horn which
hung from a chain by the side of it, and as the
blast echoed through the wood, the door slowly
unclosed, and revealed to him a wide and noble
hall, illuminated by myriads of golden lamps.</p>

<p>He looked to see who had admitted him, but
perceiving no one, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir porter, a weary traveler craves shelter for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his amazement, two hands, without any body,
moved from behind the door, and taking
hold of his arm drew him gently into the hall.</p>

<p>He perceived that he was in a fairy palace, and
putting his own hands in a friendly pressure on
one of the ghostly hands, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, but I cannot leave my horse
out in the cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hand beckoned, and another pair of shadowy
hands crossed the hall, and went outside and
led away the horse to the stable.</p>

<p>Then the merchant&#8217;s first friends led him gently
onwards till he stood in a large and splendid dining-room,
where a costly banquet was spread,
evidently intended for him, for the hands placed
a chair for him and handed him the dishes, and
poured out a refreshing drink for him, and waited
on him while he supped.</p>

<p>When his repast was over, they touched him,
and beckoned to him; and following them, he
found himself in a bedroom furnished with great
elegance; the curtains were made of butterflies&#8217;
wings sewn together.</p>

<p>The hands undressed the stranger, prepared him
a bath of rose-water, lifted him into bed and put
out the light.</p>

<p>Then the merchant fell asleep. He did not
awake till late the next morning. The sun was
streaming in through the beautiful window-curtains,
and the birds were uttering their shrill cries
in the woods. In that country a singing bird is
as rare as a white rose.</p>

<p>As he sprang out of bed some bells rang a
silvery chime, and he perceived that he had shaken
them by his own movements, for they were attached
to the golden bed-rail, and tinkled as he
shook it.</p>

<p>At the sound the bedroom door opened, and the
hands entered bearing a costly suit of clothes, all
embroidered with gold and jewels. Again they
prepared a bath of rose-water, and attended on
and dressed the merchant. And when his toilette
was completed, they led him out of his room and
downstairs to a pretty little room, where breakfast
awaited him.</p>

<p>When he had quite finished eating he thought
that it was time to resume his journey; therefore,
laying a costly diamond ring on the table, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind fairy, whoever you may be to whom I
owe this hospitality, accept my thanks and this
small token of my gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hands took the gift up, and the merchant
therefore considered that it was accepted. Then
he left the castle and proceeded to the stables to
find and saddle his horse.</p>

<p>The path led through a most enchanting garden
full of the fairest flowers, and as the merchant
proceeded, he paused occasionally to glance at the
wonderful plants and choice flowers around him.
Suddenly his eyes rested on a white rose-tree,
which was quite weighed down by its wealth of
blossoms.</p>

<p>He remembered his promise to his youngest
daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;at last I have found a <em>white</em>
rose. The fairy who has been so generous to me
already will not grudge me a single flower from
amongst so many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And bending down, he gathered a white rose.</p>

<p>At that moment he was startled by a loud and
terrific roar, and a fierce lion sprang on him and
exclaimed in tones of thunder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever dares to steal my roses shall be eaten
up alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the merchant said: &ldquo;I knew not that the
garden belonged to you; I plucked only a rose as
a present for my daughter; can nothing save my
life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the Lion, &ldquo;nothing, unless you undertake
to come back in a month, and bring me
whatever meets you first on your return home.
If you agree to this, I will give you your life;
and the rose, too, for your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man was unwilling to do so, and said,
&ldquo;It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me
most, and always runs to meet me when I go
home.&rdquo; But then he thought again, &ldquo;It may, perhaps,
be only a cat or a dog.&rdquo; And at last he
yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose,
and said he would give the Lion whatever should
meet him first on his return.</p>

<p>As he came near home, it was his youngest
and dearest daughter that met him; she came running
out and kissed him, and welcomed him home;
and when she saw that he had brought her the
rose, she was still more glad.</p>

<p>But her father began to be very sorrowful, and
to weep, saying, &ldquo;Alas! my dearest child! I have
bought this flower at a high price, for I have
said I would give you to a wild lion, and when
he has you, he will, perhaps, tear you in pieces
and eat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he told her all that had happened, and
said she should not go, let what would come of it.</p>

<p>But she comforted him, and said, &ldquo;Dear father,
the word you have given must be kept; I will go
with you to the Lion and coax him; perhaps he
will let us both return safe home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The time now arrived for the merchant to return
to the Lion&#8217;s palace, and he made preparations
for his dreadful journey. Beauty had so
fully made up her mind to accompany him, that
nothing could turn her from her purpose. Her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
father, seeing this, determined to take her, and
they accordingly set out on their journey. The
horses galloped swiftly across the forest, and
speedily reached the palace. As they entered they
were greeted with the most enchanting music; but
no living creature was to be seen. On entering
the salon, the furniture of which was of the most
costly kind, they found a rich repast prepared for
them, consisting of every delicacy. Beauty&#8217;s heart
failed her, for she feared something strange would
soon happen. They, however, sat down, and partook
freely of the various delicacies. As soon as
they had finished, the table was cleared by the
hands. Shortly afterward there was a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; replied the merchant; and immediately
the door flew open, and the same monster that
had seized the merchant entered the room.</p>

<p>The sight of his form terrified both the merchant
and his daughter; as for Beauty, she almost
fainted with fright.</p>

<p>But the Lion, having a handsome mantle thrown
over him, advanced toward them, and seating
himself opposite Beauty, said: &ldquo;Well, merchant,
I admire your fidelity in keeping your promise;
is this the daughter for whom you gathered the
rose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the merchant; &ldquo;so great is my
daughter&#8217;s love to me that she met me first on my
return home, and she is now come here in fulfillment
of my promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall have no reason to repent it,&rdquo; said
the Lion, &ldquo;for everything in this palace shall be
at her command. As for yourself, you must depart
on the morrow, and leave Beauty with me.
I will take care that no harm shall happen to her.
You will find an apartment prepared for her.&rdquo;
Having said this, he arose, wished them good-night,
and departed.</p>

<p>Poor Beauty heard all that passed, and she
trembled from head to foot with fear. As the
night was far advanced the merchant led Beauty
to the apartment prepared for her, and she retired
to rest. This room was furnished in the richest
manner. The chairs and sofas were magnificently
adorned with jewels. The hangings were of the
finest silk and gold, and on all sides were mirrors
reaching from the floor to the ceiling; it contained,
in fact, everything that was rich and splendid.</p>

<p>Beauty and her father slept soundly, notwithstanding
their sorrow at the thought of so soon
parting. In the morning they met in the salon,
where a handsome breakfast was ready prepared,
of which they partook. When they had concluded,
the merchant prepared for his departure; but
Beauty threw herself on his neck and wept. He
also wept at the thought of leaving her in this
forlorn state, but he could not delay his return
forever, so at length he rushed into the courtyard,
mounted his horse, and soon disappeared.</p>

<p>Poor Beauty, now left to herself, resolved to
be as happy as she could. She amused herself by
walking in the gardens and gathering the white
roses, and when tired of that she read and played
on the harp which she found in her room. On
her dressing-table she found these lines, which
greatly comforted her:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Welcome, Beauty! dry your tears,</span><br />
 Banish all your sighs and fears;<br />
 You are queen and mistress here,<br />
 Whate&#8217;er you ask for shall appear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After amusing herself thus for some time she
returned to the salon, where she found dinner
ready prepared. The most delightful music was
played during the whole of dinner. When Beauty
had finished, the table was cleared, and the most
delicious fruits were produced. At the same hour
as on the preceding day the Lion rapped at the
door, and asked permission to enter. Beauty was
terrified, and with a trembling voice she said:
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; He then entered, and advancing toward
Beauty, who dared not look up, he said:
&ldquo;Will you permit me to sit with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;That is
as you please,&rdquo; replied she. &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the
Lion, &ldquo;for you are mistress here; and if my company
is disagreeable I will at once retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beauty, struck with the courtesy of the Lion,
and with the friendly tone of his voice, began to
feel more courageous; and she desired him to be
seated. He then entered into the most agreeable
conversation, which so charmed Beauty that she
ventured to look up; but when she saw his terrible
face she could scarcely avoid screaming aloud.
The Lion, seeing this, got up, and making a respectful
bow, wished her good-night. Soon after,
Beauty herself retired to rest.</p>

<p>On the following day she amused herself as
before, and began to feel more reconciled to her
condition; for she had everything at her command
which could promote her happiness. As evening
approached she anticipated the visit of the Lion;
for, notwithstanding his terrible looks, his conversation
and manners were very pleasing. He
continued to visit her every day, till at length she
began to think he was not so terrible as she once
thought him. One day when they were seated together
the Lion took hold of her hand, and said
in a gentle voice: &ldquo;Beauty, will you marry me?&rdquo;
She hastily withdrew her hand, but made no reply;
at which the Lion sighed deeply and withdrew.
On his next visit he appeared sorrowful and dejected,
but said nothing. Some weeks after he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
repeated the question, when Beauty replied: &ldquo;No,
Lion, I cannot marry you, but I will do all in my
power to make you happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;This you cannot
do,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;for unless you marry me I shall
die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, say not so,&rdquo; said Beauty, &ldquo;for it is
impossible that I can ever marry you.&rdquo; The Lion
then departed, more unhappy than ever.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, Beauty did not forget her father.
One day she felt a strong desire to know how he
was, and what he was doing; at that instant she
cast her eyes on a mirror and saw her father
lying on a sick-bed, in the greatest pain, whilst
her sisters were trying on some fine dresses in
another room. At this sad sight poor Beauty
wept bitterly.</p>

<p>When the Lion came as usual he perceived her
sorrow, and inquired the cause. She told him
what she had seen, and how much she wished to
go and nurse her father. He asked her if she
would promise to return at a certain time if she
went. Beauty gave him her promise, and he immediately
presented her with a rose, like that
which her father had plucked, saying: &ldquo;Take
this rose, and you may be transported to whatever
place you choose; but, remember, I rely
on your promise to return.&rdquo; He then withdrew.</p>

<p>Beauty felt very grateful for his kindness. She
wished herself in her father&#8217;s cottage, and immediately
she was at the door.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption" style="font-size: smaller;">from a painting by j. j. shannon</span>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Full of joy, she entered the house, ran to her
father&#8217;s room, and fell on her knees by his bedside
and kissed him. His illness had been much increased
by fretting for poor Beauty, who he
thought had long since died, either from fear or
by the cruel monster. He was overcome with
joy on finding her still alive. He now soon began
to recover under the affectionate nursing of Beauty.
The two sisters were very much annoyed
at Beauty&#8217;s return, for they had hoped that the
Lion would have destroyed her. They were
greatly annoyed to see her so superbly dressed,
and felt extremely vexed to think that Beauty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
should have clothes as splendid as a queen&#8217;s,
whilst they could not get anything half so fine.</p>

<p>Beauty related all that had passed in the Beast&#8217;s
palace, and told them of her promise to return
on such a day. The two sisters were so very
jealous that they determined to ruin her prospects
if possible. The eldest said to the other: &ldquo;Why
should this minx be better off than we are? Let
us try to keep her here beyond the time; the
monster will then be so enraged with her for
breaking her promise, that he will destroy her at
once when she returns.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is well thought
of,&rdquo; replied the sister. &ldquo;We will keep her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order to succeed, they treated Beauty with
the greatest affection, and the day before her
intended departure they stole the rose which she
had told them was the means of conveying her
in an instant wherever she might wish. Beauty
was so much affected by their kindness that she
was easily persuaded to remain a few days. In
the meantime the envious sisters thought of enriching
themselves by means of the rose, and they
accordingly wished themselves in some grand
place. Instead of being carried away as they
expected, the rose withered, and they heard a
most terrible noise, which so alarmed them that
they threw down the flower and hid themselves.</p>

<p>Beauty was greatly troubled at the loss of her
rose, and sought everywhere for it, but in vain.
She happened, however, to enter her sisters&#8217; room,
and, to her great joy, saw it lying withered on
the floor; but as soon as she picked it up, it at
once recovered all its freshness and beauty. She
then remembered her broken promise, and, after
taking leave of her father, she wished herself in
the Beast&#8217;s palace, and in an instant she was
transported thither. Everything was just as she
had left it; but the sweet sounds of music which
used to greet her were now hushed, and there was
an air of apparent gloom hanging over everything.
She herself felt very melancholy, but
she knew not why.</p>

<p>At the usual time she expected a visit from
the Lion, but no Lion appeared. Beauty, wondering
what all this could mean, now reproached
herself for her ingratitude in not having returned
as she promised. She feared the poor Beast
had died of grief, and she thought that she could
have married him rather than suffer him to die.
She resolved to seek him in the morning in every
part of the palace. After a miserable and sleepless
night, she arose early and ran through every
apartment, but no Lion could be seen. With a
sorrowful heart she went into the garden, saying,
&ldquo;Oh that I had married the poor Lion who has
been so kind to me; for, terrible though he is,
I might have saved his life. I wish I could once
more see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment she arrived at a plot of grass
where the poor Lion lay as if dead. Beauty ran
toward him, and knelt by his side, and seized
his paw.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and said: &ldquo;Beauty, you
forgot your promise, in consequence of which I
must die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear Lion,&rdquo; exclaimed Beauty, weeping,
&ldquo;no, you shall not die. What can I do to save
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; asked he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Beauty, &ldquo;to save your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had these words passed her lips than
the lion-form disappeared, and she saw at her feet
a handsome Prince, who thanked her for having
broken his enchantment. He told her that a
wicked magician had condemned him to wear the
form of a lion until a beautiful lady should consent
to marry him; a kind fairy had, however,
given him the magic rose to help him.</p>

<p>At the same instant that the Prince was changed
the whole palace became full of courtiers, all of
whom had been rendered invisible when the
Prince was enchanted.</p>

<p>The Prince now led Beauty into the palace,
where she found her father. The Prince related
all to him, and asked him to allow Beauty to
become his wife, to which he cheerfully assented,
and the nuptials were solemnized with great rejoicing.</p>

<p>The good fairy appeared to congratulate the
Prince on his deliverance and on his marriage
with Beauty. As for the two sisters, she punished
them severely for their jealous and unkind behavior.
But the Prince and his wife Beauty
lived happily together in the royal palace for
many, many years.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DARLING" id="DARLING"></a>PRINCE DARLING</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a young Prince
who was so well liked by everyone in the kingdom
where he lived that they named him Prince
Darling.</p>

<p>This boy&#8217;s father, the King, was a very good
man, and his subjects loved and respected him
for his justness and kindness. The King loved
his son greatly, and he loved his subjects, too.
He was very anxious to have his son grow up to
be a splendid man, and a just ruler for his
people. The King was no longer young, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
knew that it would not be many years before
his son would be left without a father&#8217;s advice.
He knew, too, that the boy would succeed to the
throne, and would have to see that everyone in
the kingdom was treated justly and kindly.</p>

<p>One day a strange thing happened. The King
was out hunting, when suddenly a little white
rabbit leaped into his arms. The rabbit seemed
to think that in the King&#8217;s arms it would find
protection from the dogs that were chasing it,
and had nearly run it down. And the rabbit was
right; for the King stroked the trembling creature
gently, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dogs shan&#8217;t get you now, poor bunny!&rdquo;
Then the King took the rabbit home, and saw that
the best care was given it.</p>

<p>That night, after everyone else had gone to
bed, the King sat alone thinking about Prince
Darling. Suddenly a beautiful lady seemed to
come into the room. She was dressed in pure
white, and wore a wreath of white roses on her
golden hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t recognize me, do you?&rdquo; she asked
in a lovely, clear voice. &ldquo;I am the rabbit you
rescued from the dogs in the forest this afternoon.
The rabbit was really the Fairy Truth. I took
the shape of a rabbit to see whether you were
really as good as everyone said. Now I know
you are, and I shall always be your friend. Isn&#8217;t
there something you want, above everything else
in the world, which I can give you to repay you
for your goodness to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King was amazed by the lovely Fairy and
her wonderful offer. He thought at once that if
only he could win the friendship of the Fairy
Truth for Prince Darling, all would be well. So
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Fairy, above all things I should like
to know that you would be my son&#8217;s friend.
Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly. I will make him the richest or the
handsomest or the most powerful Prince in the
world. Which shall it be?&rdquo; the Fairy inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not ask any of those things, good
Fairy, but I would have him good, the best instead
of the richest of princes. If he is good and
his conscience does not trouble him, I am sure he
will be happy. Riches and power and good looks,
without goodness, cannot make him happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all true,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;and I will
do all I can to make Prince Darling good. He
will have to do most of it himself, though. I can
only advise him, praise him when he is good, and
scold him when he is bad. But I will do all I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long after this strange happening the King
died, and Prince Darling became King in his
father&#8217;s place. The Fairy Truth remembered her
promise, and came to the palace with a present
for Prince Darling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This little gold ring,&rdquo; she said, as she slipped
it on his finger, &ldquo;is my gift to you. I promised
your father that I would be your friend. This
ring will help you to keep my friendship. When
it pricks you, you will know you have done something
mean or unkind. It will warn you to stop
doing such things. If you stop, I will be your
friend; if you keep on doing wicked things, I
will become your enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Prince Darling could say a word the
Fairy vanished.</p>

<p>The Prince was curious to know whether the
ring really would do as the Fairy said. But he
never felt a single prick from the ring. Then
one day he was badly pricked. He came home
from hunting in a horrid temper, and kicked his
unoffending little dog, that was trying to be
friendly, until it howled with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Prince Darling, that is too bad of
you.&rdquo; The Fairy&#8217;s voice sounded quietly in his
ear. &ldquo;You lost your temper because things did
not go just to suit you. Even if you are a prince,
the world cannot always run just to suit your
whims. What&#8217;s worse, you hurt a poor creature
who loves you. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s being the sort
of a prince your father would be proud of, do
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince was greatly embarrassed, and thrust
his hands deep into his pockets to make himself
seem full-grown up&mdash;so he would not cry! He
promised to be good forever after.</p>

<p>But he wasn&#8217;t, and the ring pricked him often.
After a time he paid hardly any attention to the
ring at all. Finally he made up his mind that a
prince ought to be able to decide for himself
what was right or wrong. Besides, the ring
pricked so hard and so often that it made his
finger bleed. So he threw it away entirely.</p>

<p>Just after this he met Celia, the loveliest girl
he had ever seen. It seemed to him he could
never be happy until he had made her his wife;
and he lost no time in asking her to marry him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, I cannot,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>The Prince was indignant, for he thought any
girl should be proud to have him offer to marry
her and make her Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; Celia went on, &ldquo;you are handsome and
rich and powerful, I know; but the man I marry
must be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech made the Prince so angry that he
ordered his men to take Celia off to the palace
as a prisoner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, the Prince had a foster-brother who was
a very wicked man. When the Prince told him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
about Celia, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! a peasant girl refuse to marry the
Prince! How ridiculous! The whole kingdom
would laugh if they knew about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech hurt the Prince&#8217;s pride, and he
decided to make Celia consent to marry him at
any cost. He rushed off to find her. His men
had given him the key to the cell where they had
imprisoned her. But the cell was quite empty.</p>

<p>The Prince was terribly angry, and swore that
he would put to death the person who had helped
Celia to escape. It happened that this threat gave
some of the Prince&#8217;s wicked friends the very
chance they wanted to get rid of the Prince&#8217;s
tutor, an old nobleman whom they all hated because
he was good.</p>

<p>Soon these wicked men had everyone in the
court whispering: &ldquo;Yes, it was Suliman who
helped Celia escape.&rdquo; Some men even were
found who swore that Suliman himself had told
them about it. When the Prince heard it he was
still more angry. To think that his old tutor
could treat him so! He ordered his men to arrest
the supposed offender, put him in chains, as if
he were a murderer, and bring him to court.</p>

<p>No sooner was the order given than there
was a tremendous roar of thunder. The ground
was still shaking when the Fairy Truth appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until now, Prince Darling,&rdquo; the fairy said
sternly, &ldquo;I have been very gentle with you. You
have been very wicked, but I have done no more
than warn you that you were doing wrong and
becoming the very sort of man your father, the
good King, wanted you NOT to be. Now I must
take stronger measures, for you have paid no
attention to my warnings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really you are more like the wild animals than
a man and a prince. You roar with anger like
a lion. You are greedy for fine food and clothes
and a good time, as a wolf is greedy for its prey.
You are untrue to your friends, like a treacherous
snake. You even turn upon the kind tutor who
was your father&#8217;s firmest friend, and who would
like to help you, too, if you would let him. You
are as disagreeable as an angry bull, that keeps
everyone out of its neighborhood, because everyone
knows it is not safe to go near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fairy&#8217;s voice now roared forth in terrible
tones, which made Prince Darling shake from
head to heel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, I condemn you to have a hideous
body like your ugly character&mdash;part lion, part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
wolf, part snake, and part bull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince put his hand to his head, because
he felt as if he should weep at this awful sentence.
He found his face covered with a lion&#8217;s
shaggy beard; a bull&#8217;s horns had grown out of
his skull. He looked at his feet: they were those
of a wolf. His body was the long slimy body of
a snake.</p>

<p>The palace had disappeared, and he stood beside
a clear lake in a deep forest. He shuddered with
horror when he saw his reflection in the lake.
His horror turned to rage when he heard the
Fairy Truth say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your punishment has just begun. Your pride
will be hurt still more when you fall into the
hands of your own subjects. And that is what
is going to happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the Fairy said the Prince fell into the
hands of his subjects, and in a most humiliating
way, for he was caught in a trap which had
been set to catch bears. Thus he was captured
alive and led into the chief city of the kingdom.</p>

<p>There was no mourning in the town because
of the Prince&#8217;s death, by a thunderbolt, as they
supposed. Instead, there was great rejoicing, for
Suliman had been made King by the people, who
were sick and tired of the way Prince Darling
had misruled them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live King Suliman!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;His
rule will bring us peace and prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of the public park sat King Suliman.
Just as the Prince, in his ugly disguise
came up, Suliman was saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prince Darling is not dead, as you suppose.
I have accepted the crown only until he comes
back, for the Fairy Truth says he may still return,
a good and just man like his father. For
myself, I want nothing more than to see Prince
Darling come back a worthy ruler for this mighty
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech made the Prince feel very much
ashamed of himself, for it showed plainly that the
Fairy was right, and that he himself had misjudged
Suliman.</p>

<p>Meantime the Prince was put in the menagerie,
and people pointed him out as a most strange
beast, the only one of his sort ever found anywhere.
The Prince was beginning to feel like
his old, gentle self. He was even good to his
keeper, although the keeper was anything but good
to him.</p>

<p>One day a tiger broke through his cage and
attacked the keeper. At first the Prince was
pleased to see the keeper in danger of his life,
and mused: &ldquo;When he&#8217;s dead and out of the
way I can easily escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Prince&#8217;s punishment had not been in
vain, for suddenly he began to think, &ldquo;Well, the
poor old keeper; after all I&#8217;m sorry for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then as if by magic the bars of the Prince&#8217;s
cage seemed to melt away, and he rushed out to
rescue the keeper who had treated him so badly.
The man was more terrified than ever when he
saw the huge monster loose. But imagine his
amazement when the beast fell upon the tiger,
instead of crushing his (the keeper&#8217;s) life out,
as he had feared.</p>

<p>Naturally the keeper was filled with gratitude.
The strange beast&#8217;s kindness made him feel
ashamed when he remembered how badly he had
treated the animal.</p>

<p>The keeper now tried to stroke the beast&#8217;s head,
by way of gratitude, when to his amazement he
found himself stroking, not a wild animal, but a
gentle little dog.</p>

<p>The keeper picked up the dog in his arms and
took him to the King, to whom he told the strange
story of his rescue. The Queen liked the dog,
and decided to keep him for a pet. Unluckily for
Prince Darling, however, she took him to the
court doctor, who decided that too much food
would be very bad for the dog, and ordered that
he be fed nothing but bread, and very little at
that! So Prince Darling prized the small amount
of bread he got very highly indeed.</p>

<p>Once Prince Darling trotted off with his little
loaf of bread&mdash;all he would get to eat that day&mdash;to
a brook some distance away. Strange to tell,
the brook was gone, and in its place was a huge
house. Prince Darling thought the persons who
lived there must be fabulously rich, because the
house was made of precious stones and gold, and
the people were dressed in the most elegant and
expensive clothes. He heard music, and saw people
feasting and dancing.</p>

<p>Yet the people who came out of the house
presented the most forlorn appearance&mdash;ragged,
and sick, and half starved. Prince Darling saw a
poor young girl, and his heart was filled with
pity. She was eating grass and leaves, she was
so hungry. Prince Darling was hungry himself,
but he thought:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t be as hungry as that poor girl, and
to-morrow I&#8217;ll have another loaf.&rdquo; So he gave
the bread to her, and she ate it eagerly.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great outcry, and the
Prince, running in the direction whence the noise
came, saw Celia being dragged against her will
into this mysterious house. The poor little dog
could do nothing to help her. Then he thought
sadly: &ldquo;I am very angry now with these terrible
people who treat Celia so badly; but not long ago
I was myself threatening to have her killed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little dog, feeling quite forlorn, put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
its tail between its legs, as dogs often do, and
went off to watch the house where Celia was
imprisoned.</p>

<p>An upper window was opened, and a girl threw
out some food. The dog thought this was because
the girl had a kind heart. But when it
started to eat, the one to whom it had given the
bread but a short time before cried out: &ldquo;Stop!
If you touch that you will die! That food came
from the house of pleasure, and is deadly poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So once again the Prince found that his good
action had been rewarded. And the Fairy Truth,
to show her approval, transformed the little dog
into a lovely white dove.</p>

<p>The dove flew straight into the house of pleasure,
searching for Celia. No sign of her could
it find there, as she had escaped. Therefore it
decided to fly and fly all around the world until
it did get her.</p>

<p>One day it came to a desert island, where no
living person could be seen, nor any green tree
to light upon. It searched about, and after a
time found a cavern, and in it was Celia, sharing
a simple meal with an old hermit.</p>

<p>Prince Darling flew right up to Celia, lighted
on her shoulder, and tried in all the ways a dove
knows to show its affection for her. Celia in return
stroked it gently, although she, of course, had
no idea who it was. Indeed, Celia seemed delighted
to have found a new friend, and said softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have come to me, and I will
care for you and love you always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia did not expect the dove to understand
what she said. The hermit understood, however,
and asked her whether she really meant it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Celia,&rdquo; Prince Darling exclaimed, &ldquo;with
my whole heart I hope you do mean it!&rdquo; And the
astonished Celia turned and saw Prince Darling
himself standing before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celia will not stop loving you now, Prince
Darling,&rdquo; said Fairy Truth, who had been disguised
as the hermit all this time. &ldquo;She has loved
you from the beginning, and now that you have
started on the road to goodness I know she will
gladly join her fate with yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Celia and Prince Darling threw themselves
at the Fairy&#8217;s feet, and thanked her a thousand
times over for bringing them together again
after all their trials.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my children,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;if you
had not helped me I could not have brought this
to pass. And now, let&#8217;s go back to Prince Darling&#8217;s
kingdom, for I know King Suliman is
waiting eagerly for a chance to give back the
throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fairy had scarcely stopped speaking when
they found themselves in the royal palace. King
Suliman was overjoyed to see the Prince return,
and gladly yielded the throne to him again.</p>

<p>When the Prince was crowned King for the
second time he also put on again the little gold
ring which he had thrown away so long before.
He and Celia gave their whole hearts to the
effort to govern the kingdom justly and kindly.
You will know that they succeeded very well,
when I tell you that the magic ring never again
pricked Prince Darling&#8217;s finger.</p>

<h2>RUMPELSTILTSKIN</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>ADAPTED FROM THE GRIMM BROTHERS</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away
from here, there lived a miller who was very
proud, and a King who was exceedingly fond of
money.</p>

<p>The miller had a lovely daughter, and he could
not say enough about her beauty and cleverness.
He used to tell all the men who brought their
wheat to his mill, to be ground into flour, of the
wonderful things this daughter could do &ldquo;to perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, in a fit of boasting, the miller told
the servant who had brought flour from the
King&#8217;s household, that he had a daughter who
could actually turn straw into pure gold by spinning
it.</p>

<p>The messenger was astonished, and could
hardly wait to get back to the palace and see
the King. He knew how mad the King was
about money, and wanted to be the first to tell
him of the miller&#8217;s extraordinary daughter, who
could make him vastly rich so easily.</p>

<p>The King was tremendously excited by the
story, just as his servant had hoped. He sent at
once for the miller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; the King said, &ldquo;I hear you have a
daughter who can spin straw into gold. That&#8217;s a
fine story, but you can hardly expect me to
believe it without seeing it. Have your daughter
come here this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the miller went home and told his daughter
that the King wanted to see her. He dared not
tell her why. Naturally, the girl was pleased and
flattered. She put on her best dress and braided
her hair very carefully. Then she went to the
palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&#8217;re the miller&#8217;s daughter,&rdquo; said the
King. &ldquo;Now we&#8217;ll see whether you can really
spin straw into gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl thought the King must be crazy. She
felt even surer of it when he took her into a
great room full of straw with a spinning wheel
in one corner.</p>

<p>A spinning wheel, you know, is an old-fashioned
machine for making flax and cotton into
yarn and thread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&#8217;t spin all this straw into gold before
the night is over, you will die,&rdquo; the King
said, and closed the door.</p>

<p>The poor little miller&#8217;s daughter sat down in
front of the spinning wheel and cried and cried.
She didn&#8217;t know how to spin straw into gold any
more than you or I do, and she didn&#8217;t want to
die a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what&#8217;s all this crying for?&rdquo; said
a tiny voice at her ear.</p>

<p>So many queer things had happened that night
that it did not seem at all strange to have a man
appear out of nowhere. He was not exactly a
man, though. He was just a tiny little Dwarf.
And the miller&#8217;s daughter told him all her troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that&#8217;s nothing,&rdquo; the little man said; &ldquo;I
can spin that straw into gold myself. But I won&#8217;t
do it for nothing. What will you give me for
doing it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl had a necklace she was very proud of.
She hated to part with it, but she gave it to the
little man. He sat promptly down at the spinning
wheel, and in a jiffy the golden straws were flying
through his hands, and turning into threads of
pure gold. Long before daybreak the room was
full of gold instead of straw.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the King came. He could
hardly wait to learn whether the girl had done
her difficult task. When he saw the room heaped
with gold he fairly danced with joy, although that
was not very dignified for a King. Having one
room full of gold only made him want another. So
he took the miller&#8217;s daughter to a larger room,
where there was even more straw. Once more he
told her that if she wanted to live she must turn
the straw to gold.</p>

<p>The little Dwarf helped her out again. This
time she had to pay him with her ring.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the King saw all the
gold, he was still not satisfied. He was getting
rich so easily that he hated to stop. So he had
the miller&#8217;s daughter led to the largest room in the
palace, and had it filled with straw for her to spin
into gold.</p>

<p>This time, however, he told the girl that if she
succeeded for the third time in her task she should
become his wife. &ldquo;She&#8217;s only the poor miller&#8217;s
daughter,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but look how rich
she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl was not surprised to see the Dwarf
come in. He was quite disagreeable, though,
when she said she had nothing to give him this
time for spinning the gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you no reward for me?
Then you must promise me your first child after
you become Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There seemed nothing to do but to promise the
little fellow what he asked. &ldquo;Lots of things may
happen before the promise is fulfilled,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>

<p>So the straw was spun into gold, and the King
was greatly pleased. Soon after this the miller&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
daughter became Queen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">&ldquo;this time she had to pay him with her ring&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A year passed, and the whole kingdom was celebrating
the birth of a son to the King and Queen.
The Queen was so happy about her child that she
quite forgot the promise she had made to the
manikin who had saved her life. But <em>he</em> had not
forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me that child,&rdquo; said he one day, appearing,
as was his habit, out of nowhere. The Queen
was frightened, yet refused to give up her child.
She offered him anything else he would name,
but the child he could never have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is the only thing
I want.&rdquo; Yet he was sorry for the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll let you have the
child for three days. If you can tell me my name
before this time is up, you can keep your little
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen sent messengers to search the country
and bring her all the unusual names they could
discover.</p>

<p>After one day the manikin came back to find
out whether his name had been discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your name Kasper, or Melchior, or Belshayzar?&rdquo;
the Queen asked in a worried manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; the little fellow said to each name
she suggested.</p>

<p>The second day the Queen tried him with some
names she had made up herself. &ldquo;Perhaps they
call you Sheepshanks, or Cruickshanks, or Spindleshanks?&rdquo;
she suggested eagerly. But each time
the manikin shook his head haughtily and answered,
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor Queen was nearly crazy with worry
on the third day, and the messengers could find no
more queer names. One of them, however, told
this story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was drawing to the top of a high hill, and
the road where I was riding went through a thick
wood. Not a new name had I learned all day.
But suddenly I came upon a hut, and before it
was a big fire. A little man was hopping madly
about the fire, and singing at the top of his voice:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now a feast I must prepare,</span><br />
  Of the finest royal fare.<br />
  Soon the Queen must give her son<br />
  To me, for I&#8217;m the lucky one.<br />
  That Rumpelstiltskin is my name,<br />
  She will never guess&mdash;the silly dame.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen was so delighted she did not even
mind being called silly. Soon the manikin came in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said defiantly, &ldquo;I guess you don&#8217;t
know my name yet, do you? Remember, this is
your last chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; said the Queen, pretending to be
very anxious. &ldquo;Is it John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered the manikin. &ldquo;Give me the
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; the Queen asked softly, &ldquo;by any chance
Rumpelstiltskin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some witch has told you that! Some witch
had told you that!&rdquo; cried the little man; and he
dashed his left foot in a rage so deep into the
floor that he was forced to lay hold of it with
both hands to pull it out. Then he made the best
of his way off, while everybody laughed at him
for having had all his trouble for nothing.</p>

<h2><a name="RAP" id="RAP"></a>RAPUNZEL,<br />
OR THE FAIR MAID WITH GOLDEN HAIR</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>There were once a man and a woman who
wished very much to have a little child. Now,
these people had a small window in their cottage
which looked out into a beautiful garden full of
the most lovely flowers and vegetables. There
was a high wall round it, but even had there
not been no one would have ventured to enter the
garden, because it belonged to a sorceress, whose
power was so great that every one feared her.</p>

<p>One day the woman stood at the window looking
into the garden, and she saw a bed which was
planted full of most beautiful lettuces. As she
looked at them she began to wish she had some
to eat, but she could not ask for them.</p>

<p>Day after day her wish for these lettuces grew
stronger, and the knowledge that she could not
get them so worried her that at last she became
so pale and thin that her husband was quite
alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, dear wife?&rdquo; he
asked one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I do not have some of that
nice lettuce which grows in the garden behind our
house, I feel that I shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The husband, who loved his wife dearly, said
to himself: &ldquo;Rather than my wife should die,
I will get some of this lettuce for her, cost what
it may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in the evening twilight he climbed over the
wall into the garden of the Witch, hastily gathered
a handful of the lettuces, and brought them to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
wife. She made a salad, and ate it with great
eagerness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">
<img src="images/img41.jpg" width="431" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the fair maiden with golden hair<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">from a drawing by edith w. yaffee</span></span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It pleased her so much and tasted so good that,
after two or three days had passed, she gave her
husband no rest till he promised to get her some
more. So again in the evening twilight he climbed
the wall, but as he slid down into the garden on
the other side he was terribly alarmed at seeing
the Witch standing near him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you here?&rdquo; she said with a fierce
look. &ldquo;You have climbed over the wall into my
garden like a thief and stolen my lettuces; you
shall pay dearly for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the poor man, &ldquo;let me entreat
for mercy; I have only taken it in a case of
extreme need. My wife has seen your lettuces
from her window, and she wished for them so
much that she said she should die if she could
not have some of them to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Witch&#8217;s anger cooled a little, and she
replied: &ldquo;If what you tell me is true, then I will
give you full permission to take as many lettuces
as you like, on one condition: you must give up
to me the child which your wife may bring into
the world. I will be very kind to it, and be as
careful of it as a mother could be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The husband in his alarm promised everything
the Witch asked, and took away with him as many
lettuces as his wife wanted.</p>

<p>Not many weeks after this the wife became the
mother of a beautiful little girl, and in a short
time the Witch appeared and claimed her according
to the husband&#8217;s promise. Thus they were
obliged to give up their child, which she took
away with her directly, and gave her the name
of Letitia, but she was always called Lettice, after
the name of the vegetable which grew in the
garden.</p>

<p>Lettice was the most beautiful child under the
sun, and as soon as she reached the age of twelve
years the Witch locked her up in a tower that
stood in a forest, and this tower had no steps,
nor any entrance, excepting a little window.
When the Witch, wished to visit Lettice, she
would place herself under this window and sing:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Lettice, Lettice, let down your hair,</span><br />
 That I may climb without a stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lettice had the most long and beautiful hair like
spun-gold; and when she heard the voice of the
Witch she would unbind her golden locks and let
them fall loose over the window sill, from which
they hung down to such a length that the Witch
could draw herself up by them into the tower.</p>

<p>Two years passed in this manner, when it happened
one day that the King&#8217;s son rode through
the forest. While passing near the tower he
heard such a lovely song that he could not help
stopping to listen. It was Lettice, who tried to
lighten her solitude by the sound of her own
sweet voice.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s son was very eager to obtain a
glimpse of the singer, but he sought in vain for
a door to the tower; there was not one to be
found.</p>

<p>So he rode home, but the song had made such
an impression on his heart that he went daily
into the forest to listen. Once, while he stood
behind a tree, he saw the Witch approach the
tower, and heard her say:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Lettice, Lettice, let down your hair,</span><br />
 That I may climb without a stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently he saw a quantity of long golden hair
hanging down low over the window sill, and the
Witch climbing up by it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the young Prince, &ldquo;if that is the
ladder on which persons can mount and enter,
I will take the first opportunity of trying my
luck that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So on the following day, as it began to grow
dark, he placed himself under the window, and
cried:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Lettice, Lettice, let down your hair,</span><br />
 That I may climb without a stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately the hair fell over the window, and
the young Prince quickly climbed up and entered
the room where the young maiden lived.</p>

<p>Lettice was dreadfully frightened at seeing a
strange man come into the room through the
window; but the King&#8217;s son looked at her with
such friendly eyes, and began to converse with
her so kindly, that she soon lost all fear.</p>

<p>He told her that he had heard her singing,
and that her song had excited such a deep emotion
in his heart that he could not rest till he had seen
her. On hearing this Lettice ceased to fear him,
and they talked together for some time, till at
length the Prince asked her if she would take
him for a husband. For a time she hesitated,
although she saw that he was young and handsome,
and he had told her he was a prince.</p>

<p>At last she said to herself: &ldquo;He will certainly
love me better than old Mother Grethel does.&rdquo;
So she placed her hand in his, and said: &ldquo;I would
willingly go with you and be your wife, but I do
not know in the least how to get away from
this place. Unless,&rdquo; she added, after a pause,
&ldquo;you will bring me every day some strong silk
cord; then I will weave a ladder of it, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
it is finished I will descend upon it, and you shall
take me away on your horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince readily agreed to this, and promised
to come and see her every evening till the ladder
was finished, for the old Witch always came in
the daytime.</p>

<p>The Witch had never seen the Prince; she
knew nothing of his visits till one day Lettice
said innocently: &ldquo;I shall not have such a heavy
weight as you to draw up much longer, Mother
Grethel, for the King&#8217;s son is coming very soon
to fetch me away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wicked child!&rdquo; cried the Witch; &ldquo;what
do I hear you say? I thought I had hidden you
from all the world, and now you have betrayed
me!&rdquo; In her wrath she caught hold of Lettice&#8217;s
beautiful hair, and struck her several times with
her left hand. Then she seized a pair of scissors
and cut Lettice&#8217;s hair, while the beautiful locks,
glistening like gold, fell to the ground. And she
was so hard-hearted after this that she dragged
poor Lettice out into the forest, to a wild and
desert place, and left her there in sorrow and
great distress.</p>

<p>On the same day on which the poor maiden
had been exiled the Witch tied the locks of hair
which she had cut off poor Lettice&#8217;s golden head
into a kind of tail, and hung it over the window
sill.</p>

<p>In the evening the Prince came and cried:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Lettice, Lettice, let down your hair,</span><br />
 That I may climb without a stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Witch let the hair down, and the
King&#8217;s son climbed up; but at the open window
he found not his dear Lettice, but a wicked witch
who looked at him with cruel and malicious eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried with a sneer, &ldquo;you are come
to fetch your loving bride, I suppose; but the
beautiful bird has flown from the nest, and will
never sing any more. The cat has fetched it
away, and she intends also to scratch your eyes
out. To thee is Lettice lost; thou wilt never
behold her again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince felt almost out of his mind with
grief as he heard this, and in his despair he
sprang out of the tower window and fell among
the thorns and brambles beneath. He certainly
escaped with his life, but the thorns stuck into
his eyes and blinded them. After this he wandered
about the wood for days, eating only wild
roots and berries, and did nothing but lament
and weep for the loss of his beloved bride.</p>

<p>So wandered he for a whole year in misery, till
at last he came upon the desert place where
Lettice had been banished and lived in her sorrow.</p>

<p>As he drew near he heard a voice which
he seemed to recognize, and advancing toward the
sound came within sight of Lettice, who recognized
him at once, with tears. Two of her tears
fell on his eyes, and so healed and cleared them
of the injury done by the thorns that he could
soon see as well as ever. Then he traveled with
her to his kingdom, and she became his wife,
and the remainder of their days were spent in
happiness and content.</p>

<h2><a name="SNOW" id="SNOW"></a>SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>There was once a poor Widow, who lived alone
in her hut with her two children, who were called
Snow-White and Rose-Red, because they were
like the flowers which bloomed on two rose-bushes
which grew before the cottage. But they
were two as pious, good, industrious, and amiable
children as any that were in the world, only
Snow-White was more quiet and gentle than
Rose-Red. For Rose-Red would run and jump
about the meadows, seeking flowers, and catching
butterflies, while Snow-White sat at home helping
her Mother to keep house, or reading to her, if
there were nothing else to do.</p>

<p>The two children loved one another dearly,
and always walked hand-in-hand when they went
out together; and ever when they talked of it
they agreed that they would never separate from
each other, and that whatever one had the other
should share. Often they ran deep into the forest
and gathered wild berries; but no beast ever
harmed them. For the hare would eat cauliflowers
out of their hands, the fawn would graze
at their side, the goats would frisk about them
in play, and the birds remained perched on the
boughs singing as if nobody were near.</p>

<p>No accidents ever befell them; and if they
stayed late in the forest, and night came upon
them, they used to lie down on the moss and
sleep till morning; and because their Mother knew
they would do so, she felt no concern about them.
One time when they had thus passed the night
in the forest, and the dawn of morning awoke
them, they saw a beautiful Child dressed in shining
white sitting near their couch. She got up
and looked at them kindly, but without saying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
anything went into the forest; and when the
children looked round they saw that where they
had slept was close to the edge of a pit, into which
they would have certainly fallen had they walked
a couple of steps further in the dark.</p>

<p>Their Mother told them the figure they had
seen was, doubtless, the good angel who watches
over children.</p>

<p>Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their Mother&#8217;s
cottage so clean that it was a pleasure to enter it.
Every morning in the summertime Rose-Red
would first put the house in order, and then
gather a nosegay for her Mother, in which she
always placed a bud from each rose-tree. Every
winter&#8217;s morning Snow-White would light the
fire and put the kettle on to boil, and, although
the kettle was made of copper, it yet shone like
gold, because it was scoured so well. In the
evenings, when the flakes of snow were falling,
the Mother would say, &ldquo;Go, Snow-White, and bolt
the door;&rdquo; and then they used to sit down on
the hearth, and the Mother would put on her
spectacles and read out of a great book while
her children sat spinning. By their side, too, lay
a little lamb, and on a perch behind them a little
white dove reposed with her head tucked under
her wing.</p>

<p>One evening when they were thus sitting comfortably
together, there came a knock at the door,
as if somebody wished to come in. &ldquo;Make haste,
Rose-Red,&rdquo; cried her Mother; &ldquo;make haste and
open the door; perhaps there is some traveler outside
who needs shelter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rose-Red went and drew the bolt and opened
the door, expecting to see some poor man outside;
but instead, a great fat bear poked his black
head in. Rose-Red shrieked out and ran back,
the little lamb bleated, the dove fluttered on her
perch, and Snow-White hid herself behind her
Mother&#8217;s bed. The Bear, however, began to
speak, and said, &ldquo;Be not afraid, I will do you
no harm; but I am half frozen, and wish to
come in and warm myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Bear!&rdquo; cried the Mother; &ldquo;come in and
lie down before the fire; but take care you do
not burn your skin;&rdquo; and then she continued,
&ldquo;Come here, Rose-Red and Snow-White, the Bear
will not harm you, he means honorably.&rdquo; So
they both came back, and by degrees the lamb too
and the dove overcame their fears and welcomed
the rough visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You children!&rdquo; said the Bear, before he entered,
&ldquo;come and knock the snow off my coat.&rdquo;
And they fetched their brooms and swept him
clean. Then he stretched himself before the fire
and grumbled out his satisfaction, and in a little
while the children became familiar enough to play
tricks with the unwieldy animal. They pulled his
long shaggy skin, set their feet upon his back
and rolled him to and fro, and even ventured to
beat him with a hazel-stick, laughing when he
grumbled. The Bear bore all their tricks good-temperedly,
and if they hit too hard he cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Leave me my life, you children,</span><br />
 Snow-White and Rose-Red,<br />
 Or you&#8217;ll never wed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When bedtime came and the others were gone,
the Mother said to the Bear, &ldquo;You may sleep
here on the hearth if you like, and then you
will be safely protected from the cold and bad
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as day broke the two children let
the Bear out again, and he trotted away over
the snow, and ever afterward he came every
evening at a certain hour. He would lie down
on the hearth and allow the children to play with
him as much as they liked, till by degrees they
became so accustomed to him that the door was
left unbolted till their black friend arrived.</p>

<p>But as soon as spring returned, and everything
out of doors was green again, the Bear one
morning told Snow-White that he must leave her,
and could not return during the whole summer.
&ldquo;Where are you going, then, dear Bear?&rdquo; asked
Snow-White. &ldquo;I am obliged to go into the forest
and guard my treasures from the evil Dwarfs;
for in winter, when the ground is hard, they are
obliged to keep in their holes and cannot work
through; but now, since the sun has thawed the
earth and warmed it, the Dwarfs pierce through
and steal all they can find; and what has once
passed into their hands, and gets concealed by
them in their caves, is not easily brought to light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snow-White, however, was very sad at the departure
of the Bear, and opened the door so
hesitatingly, that when he pressed through it he
left behind on the latch a piece of his hairy coat;
and through the hole which was made in his coat
Snow-White fancied she saw the glittering of
gold, but she was not quite certain of it. The
Bear, however, ran hastily away, and was soon
hidden behind the trees.</p>

<p>Some time afterward the Mother sent the
children into the woods to gather sticks, and while
doing so they came to a tree which was lying
across the path, on the trunk of which something
kept bobbing up and down from the grass, and
they could not imagine what it was. When they
came nearer they saw a Dwarf, with an old
wrinkled face and a snow-white beard a yard long.
The end of this beard was fixed in a split of the
tree, and the little man kept jumping about like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
a dog tied by a chain, for he did not know how
to free himself. He glared at the Maidens with
his red, fiery eyes, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Why do you
stand there? Are you going to pass without
offering me any assistance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done, little man?&rdquo; asked Rose-Red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stupid, gazing goose!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;I
wanted to have split the tree in order to get a
little wood for my kitchen, for the little food
which we use is soon burnt up with great faggots,
not like what you rough greedy people devour!
I had driven the wedge in properly, and everything
was going on well, when the smooth wood
flew upward, and the tree closed so suddenly together,
that I could not draw my beautiful beard
out; and here it sticks, and I cannot get away.
There, don&#8217;t laugh, you milk-faced things! Are
you dumbfounded?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children took all the pains they could to
pull the Dwarf&#8217;s beard out, but without success.
&ldquo;I will run and fetch some help,&rdquo; cried Rose-Red
at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crack-brained sheep&#8217;s-head that you are!&rdquo;
snarled the Dwarf; &ldquo;what are you going to call
other people for? You are two too many now
for me; can you think of nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be impatient,&rdquo; replied Snow-White: &ldquo;I
have thought of something;&rdquo; and pulling her scissors
out of her pocket, she cut off the end of the
beard. As soon as the Dwarf found himself at
liberty he snatched up his sack, which laid between
the roots of the tree filled with gold, and,
throwing it over his shoulder, marched off, grumbling,
and groaning, and crying &ldquo;Stupid people! to
cut off a piece of my beautiful beard. Plague
take you!&rdquo; And away he went without once looking
at the children.</p>

<p>Some time afterward Snow-White and Rose-Red
went a-fishing and as they neared the pond
they saw something like a great locust hopping
about on the bank, as if going to jump into the
water. They ran up and recognized the Dwarf;
&ldquo;What are you after?&rdquo; asked Rose-Red; &ldquo;you
will fall into the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite such a simpleton as that,&rdquo; replied
the Dwarf; &ldquo;but do you not see this fish
will pull me in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little man had been sitting there angling,
and, unfortunately, the wind had entangled his
beard with the fishing-line; and so when a great
fish bit at the bait, the strength of the weak little
fellow was not able to draw it out, and the fish
had the best of the struggle. The Dwarf held
on by the reeds and rushes which grew near, but
to no purpose, for the fish pulled him where it
liked, and he must soon have been drawn into
the pond. Luckily just then the two Maidens
arrived, and tried to release the beard of the
Dwarf from the fishing-line, but both were too
closely entangled for it to be done. So the
Maiden pulled out her scissors again and cut off
another piece of the beard.</p>

<p>When the Dwarf saw this done he was in a
great rage, and exclaimed, &ldquo;You donkey! that is
the way to disfigure my face. Was it not enough
to cut it once, but you must now take away the
best part of my fine beard? I dare not show
myself again now to my own people. I wish you
had run the soles off your boots before you had
come here!&rdquo; So saying he took up a bag of
pearls, which lay among the rushes, and, without
speaking another word, slipped off and disappeared
behind a stone.</p>

<p>Not many days after this adventure, it chanced
that the Mother sent the two Maidens to the next
town to buy thread, needles and pins, laces, and
ribbons. Their road passed over a common, on
which, here and there, great pieces of rock were
lying about. Just over their heads they saw a
great bird flying round and round, and every now
and then dropping lower and lower, till at last it
flew down behind a rock. Immediately afterward
they heard a piercing shriek, and, running up,
they saw with affright that the eagle had caught
their old acquaintance, the Dwarf, and was trying
to carry him off. The compassionate children
thereupon laid hold of the little man, and held
him fast till the bird gave up the struggle and
flew off.</p>

<p>As soon, then, as the Dwarf had recovered
from his fright, he exclaimed in his squeaking
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not hold me more gently? You
have seized my fine brown coat in such a manner
that it is all torn and full of holes, meddling
and interfering rubbish that you are!&rdquo; With these
words he shouldered a bag filled with precious
stones, and slipped away to his cave among the
rocks.</p>

<p>The Maidens were now accustomed to his ingratitude,
and so they walked on to the town and
transacted their business there. Coming home
they returned over the same common, and unawares
walked up to a certain clean spot, on which
the Dwarf had shaken out his bag of precious
stones, thinking nobody was near. The sun was
shining and the bright stones glittered in its
beams, and displayed such a variety of colors that
the two Maidens stopped to admire them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">the two maidens arrived and tried to release the beard of
the dwarf</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you standing there gaping for?&rdquo;
asked the Dwarf, while his face grew as red as
copper with rage: he was continuing to abuse
the poor Maidens, when a loud roaring noise was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
heard, and presently a great black Bear came rolling
out of the forest. The Dwarf jumped up
terrified, but he could not gain his retreat before
the Bear overtook him. Thereupon he cried out,
&ldquo;Spare me, my dear Lord Bear! I will give you
all my treasures. See these beautiful precious
stones which lie here; only give me my life; for
what have you to fear from a little fellow like
me? You could not touch me with your big teeth.
There are two wicked girls, take them; they would
make nice morsels; as fat as young quails; eat
them, for heaven&#8217;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bear, however, without troubling himself
to speak, gave the bad-hearted Dwarf a single
blow with his paw, and he never stirred after.</p>

<p>The Maidens were then going to run away, but
the Bear called after them, &ldquo;Snow-White and
Rose-Red, fear not! Wait a bit, and I will
accompany you.&rdquo; They recognized his voice and
stopped; and when the Bear came, his rough coat
suddenly fell off, and he stood up a tall man,
dressed entirely in gold. &ldquo;I am a King&#8217;s son,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and was condemned by the wicked
Dwarf, who stole all my treasures, to wander
about in this forest in the form of a bear till
his death released me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they went home, and Snow-White was
married to the Prince, and Rose-Red to his brother,
with whom they shared the immense treasure
which the Dwarf had collected. The old Mother
also lived for many years happily with her two
children; and the rose-trees which had stood
before the cottage were planted now before the
palace, and produced every year beautiful red and
white roses.</p>

<h2><a name="HANSEL" id="HANSEL"></a>HANSEL AND GRETHEL</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there dwelt near a large
wood a poor wood-cutter, with his wife and two
children by his former marriage, a little boy
called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel. He had
little enough to break or bite; and once, when
there was a great famine in the land, he could
not procure even his daily bread; and as he lay
thinking in his bed one evening, rolling about for
trouble, he sighed, and said to his wife, &ldquo;What
will become of us? How can we feed our children,
when we have no more than we can eat
ourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know, then, my husband,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;we
will lead them away, quite early in the morning,
into the thickest part of the wood, and there
make them a fire, and give them each a little
piece of bread; then we will go to our work, and
leave them alone, so they will not find the way
home again, and we shall be freed from them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, wife,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that I can never do;,
how can you bring your heart to leave my children
all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts
will soon come and tear them to pieces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you simpleton!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;then we must
all four die of hunger; you had better plane the
coffins for us.&rdquo; But she left him no peace till
he consented, saying, &ldquo;Ah, but I shall regret the
poor children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two children, however, had not gone to
sleep for very hunger, and so they overheard
what the stepmother said to their father. Grethel
wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, &ldquo;What will become
of us?&rdquo; &ldquo;Be quiet, Grethel,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;do
not cry&mdash;I will soon help you.&rdquo; And as soon as
their parents had fallen asleep, he got up, put on
his coat, and, unbarring the back door, slipped out.
The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles
which lay before the door seemed like silver
pieces, they glittered so brightly. Hansel stooped
down, and put as many into his pocket as it would
hold; and then going back he said to Grethel,
&ldquo;Be comforted, dear sister, and sleep in peace;
God will not forsake us.&rdquo; And so saying, he
went to bed again.</p>

<p>The next morning, before the sun arose, the
wife went and awoke the two children. &ldquo;Get up,
you lazy things; we are going into the forest to
chop wood.&rdquo; Then she gave them each a piece
of bread, saying, &ldquo;There is something for your
dinner; do not eat it before the time, for you will
get nothing else.&rdquo; Grethel took the bread in her
apron, for Hansel&#8217;s pocket was full of pebbles;
and so they all set out upon their way. When
they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still,
and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated
several times, till his father said, &ldquo;Hansel, what
are you peeping at, and why do you lag behind?
Take care, and remember your legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, father,&rdquo; said Hansel, &ldquo;I am looking at my
white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and
trying to say good-by.&rdquo; &ldquo;You simpleton!&rdquo; said
the wife, &ldquo;that is not a cat; it is only the sun
shining on the white chimney.&rdquo; But in reality
Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time
he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket
upon the path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">grethel and the witch<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">from a drawing by malcolm patterson</span></span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they came to the middle of the wood,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the father told the children to collect wood, and
he would make them a fire, so that they should
not be cold. So Hansel and Grethel gathered together
quite a little mountain of twigs. Then
they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up
high, the wife said, &ldquo;Now, you children, lie down
near the fire, and rest yourselves, whilst we go
into the forest and chop wood; when we are
ready, I will come and call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and
when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread;
and because they could hear the blows of an axe
they thought their father was near; but it was not
an axe, but a branch which he had bound to a
withered tree, so as to be blown to and fro by
the wind. They waited so long, that at last their
eyes closed from weariness, and they fell fast
asleep. When they awoke, it was quite dark, and
Grethel began to cry, &ldquo;How shall we get out of
the wood?&rdquo; But Hansel tried to comfort her by
saying, &ldquo;Wait a little while till the moon rises,
and then we will quickly find the way.&rdquo; The
moon soon shone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister&#8217;s
hand, followed the pebbles, which glittered
like new-coined silver pieces, and showed them the
path. All night long they walked on, and as
day broke they came to their father&#8217;s house.
They knocked at the door, and when the wife
opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed,
&ldquo;You wicked children! why did you sleep
so long in the wood? We thought you were
never coming home again.&rdquo; But their father
was very glad, for it had grieved his heart to
leave them all alone.</p>

<p>Not long afterward there was again great
scarcity in every corner of the land; and one
night the children overheard their mother saying
to their father, &ldquo;Everything is again consumed;
we have only half a loaf left, and then the song
is ended: the children must be sent away. We
will take them deeper into the wood, so that
they may not find the way out again: it is the
only means of escape for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her husband felt heavy at heart, and
thought, &ldquo;It were better to share the last crust
with the children.&rdquo; His wife, however, would
listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and
reproached him without end.</p>

<p>He who says A must say B too; and he who
consents the first time must also the second.</p>

<p>The children, however, had heard the conversation
as they lay awake, and as soon as the old
people went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to
pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had
locked the door, so that he could not get out.
Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, &ldquo;Do
not cry; sleep in quiet; the good God will not
forsake us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the morning the stepmother came and
pulled them out of bed, and gave them each a
slice of bread, which was still smaller than the
former piece. On the way, Hansel broke his in
his pocket, and, stooping every now and then,
dropped a crumb upon the path. &ldquo;Hansel, why
do you stop and look about?&rdquo; said the father,
&ldquo;keep in the path.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am looking at my little
dove,&rdquo; answered Hansel, &ldquo;nodding a good-by to
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Simpleton!&rdquo; said the wife, &ldquo;that is no
dove, but only the sun shining on the chimney.&rdquo;
But Hansel still kept dropping crumbs as he went
along.</p>

<p>The mother led the children deep into the wood,
where they had never been before, and there
making an immense fire, she said to them, &ldquo;Sit
down here and rest, and when you feel tired you
can sleep for a little while. We are going into
the forest to hew wood, and in the evening, when
we are ready, we will come and fetch you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When noon came Grethel shared her bread with
Hansel, who had strewn his on the path. Then
they went to sleep; but the evening arrived and
no one came to visit the poor children, and in
the dark night they awoke, and Hansel comforted
his sister by saying, &ldquo;Only wait, Grethel, till the
moon comes out, then we shall see the crumbs of
bread which I have dropped, and they will show
us the way home.&rdquo; The moon shone and they got
up, but they could not see any crumbs, for the
thousands of birds which had been flying about
in the woods and fields had picked them all up.
Hansel kept saying to Grethel, &ldquo;We will soon find
the way;&rdquo; but they did not, and they walked the
whole night long and the next day, but still they
did not come out of the wood; and they got so
hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries
which they found upon the bushes. Soon they got
so tired that they could not drag themselves along,
so they lay down under a tree and went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was now the third morning since they had
left their father&#8217;s house, and they still walked on;
but they only got deeper and deeper into the wood,
and Hansel saw that if help did not come very
soon they would die of hunger. As soon as it
was noon they saw a beautiful snow-white bird
sitting upon a bough, which sang so sweetly that
they stood still and listened to it. It soon left off,
and spreading its wings flew off; and they followed
it until it arrived at a cottage, upon the roof
of which it perched; and when they went close
up to it they saw that the cottage was made of
bread and cakes, and the window-panes were of
clear sugar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go in here,&rdquo; said Hansel, &ldquo;and have a
glorious feast. I will eat a piece of the roof,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and you can eat the window. Will they not be
sweet?&rdquo; So Hansel reached up and broke a piece
off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while
Grethel stepped up to the window and began to
bite it. Then a sweet voice called out in the
room, &ldquo;Tip-tap, tip-tap, who raps at my door?&rdquo;
and the children answered, &ldquo;The wind, the wind,
the child of heaven;&rdquo; and they went on eating
without interruption. Hansel thought the roof
tasted very nice, and so he tore off a great piece;
while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the
window, and sat down quite contentedly. Just
then the door opened, and a very old woman,
walking upon crutches, came out. Hansel and
Grethel were so frightened that they let fall
what they had in their hands; but the old woman,
nodding her head, said &ldquo;Ah, you dear children,
what has brought you here? Come in and stop
with me, and no harm shall befall you;&rdquo; and so
saying she led them into her cottage. A good
meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples,
and nuts was spread on the table, and in the back
room were two nice little beds, covered with
white, where Hansel and Grethel laid themselves
down, and thought themselves in heaven. The
old woman behaved very kindly to them, but
in reality she was a wicked witch who waylaid
children and built the breadhouse in order to
entice them in; but as soon as they were in her
power she killed them, cooked and ate them, and
made a great festival of the day. Witches have
red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have
a fine sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that
they know when children approach them. When
Hansel and Grethel came near the witch&#8217;s house
she laughed wickedly, saying, &ldquo;Here come two
who shall not escape me.&rdquo; And early in the
morning, before they awoke, she went up to them,
and saw how lovingly they lay sleeping, with
their chubby red cheeks; and she mumbled to
herself, &ldquo;That will be a good bite.&rdquo; Then she
took up Hansel with her rough hand, and shut
him up in a little cage with a lattice-door; and
although he screamed loudly it was of no use.
Grethel came next, and, shaking her till she
awoke, she said, &ldquo;Get up, you lazy thing, and
fetch some water to cook something good for
your brother, who must remain in that stall and
get fat; when he is fat enough I shall eat him.&rdquo;
Grethel began to cry, but it was all useless, for
the old witch made her do as she wished. So a
nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got
nothing else but a crab&#8217;s claw.</p>

<p>Every morning the old witch came to the cage
and said, &ldquo;Hansel, stretch out your finger that
I may feel whether you are getting fat.&rdquo; But
Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old
woman, having very bad sight, thought it was
his finger, and wondered very much that he did
not get more fat. When four weeks had passed,
and Hansel still kept quite lean, she lost all
her patience, and would not wait any longer.
&ldquo;Grethel,&rdquo; she called out in a passion, &ldquo;get some
water quickly; be Hansel fat or lean, this morning
I will kill and cook him.&rdquo; Oh, how the poor
little sister grieved, as she was forced to fetch
the water, and fast the tears ran down her
cheeks! &ldquo;Dear good God, help us now!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Had we only been eaten by the wild
beasts in the wood, then we should have died
together.&rdquo; But the old witch called out, &ldquo;Leave
off that noise; it will not help you a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So early in the morning Grethel was forced
to go out and fill the kettle, and make a fire.
&ldquo;First, we will bake, however,&rdquo; said the old
woman; &ldquo;I have already heated the oven and
kneaded the dough;&rdquo; and so saying, she pushed
poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the
flames were burning fiercely. &ldquo;Creep in,&rdquo; said
the witch, &ldquo;and see if it is hot enough, and then
we will put in the bread;&rdquo; but she intended when
Grethel got in to shut up the oven and let her
bake, so that she might eat her as well as Hansel.
Grethel perceived what her thoughts were, and
said, &ldquo;I do not know how to do it; how shall
I get in?&rdquo; &ldquo;You stupid goose,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the
opening is big enough. See, I could even get in myself!&rdquo;
and she got up, and put her head into the
oven. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she
fell right in, and then shutting the iron door she
bolted it. Oh! how horribly she howled; but
Grethel ran away, and left the ungodly witch to
burn to ashes.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;she led them into her cottage&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening his door,
called out, &ldquo;Hansel, we are saved; the old witch
is dead.&rdquo; So he sprang out, like a bird out of
his cage when the door is opened; and they were
so glad that they fell upon each other&#8217;s neck,
and kissed each other over and over again. And
now, as there was nothing to fear, they went into
the witch&#8217;s house, where in every corner were
caskets full of pearls and precious stones. &ldquo;These
are better than pebbles,&rdquo; said Hansel, putting as
many into his pocket as it would hold; while
Grethel thought, &ldquo;I will take some home too,&rdquo;
and filled her apron full. &ldquo;We must be off now,&rdquo;
said Hansel, &ldquo;and get out of this enchanted forest;&rdquo;
but when they had walked for two hours
they came to a large piece of water. &ldquo;We cannot
get over,&rdquo; said Hansel; &ldquo;I can see no bridge at
all.&rdquo; &ldquo;And there is no boat either,&rdquo; said Grethel,
&ldquo;but there swims a white duck, I will ask her to
help us over;&rdquo; and she sang:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Little Duck, good little duck,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grethel and Hansel, here we stand;</span><br />
There is neither stile nor bridge,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take us on your back to land.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat
himself on, and bade his sister sit behind him.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Grethel, &ldquo;that will be too much
for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a
time.&rdquo; This the good little bird did, and when
both were happily arrived on the other side, and
had gone a little way, they came to a well-known
wood, which they knew the better every
step they went, and at last they perceived their
father&#8217;s house. Then they began to run, and,
bursting into the house, they fell on their father&#8217;s
neck. He had not had one happy hour since he
had left the children in the forest: and his wife
was dead. Grethel shook her apron, and the
pearls and precious stones rolled out upon the
floor, and Hansel threw down one handful after
the other out of his pocket. Then all their sorrows
were ended, and they lived in happiness.</p>

<p>My tale is done. There runs a mouse; whoever
catches her may make a great, great cap out
of her fur.</p>

<h2>THE FLAG-BEARER</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY CAROLYN SHERWIN BAILEY</strong></p>


<p>The primary class had a very beautiful American
flag, and some child was going to carry it
from the schoolroom across the park and into
the Town Hall on the holiday. All the primary
children would march after the flag, and they
were going to sing &ldquo;America&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Star
Spangled Banner.&rdquo; It would be a wonderful day
and each child wanted to carry the flag.</p>

<p>No one was sure who would be chosen as flag-bearer,
but their teacher had said the week before:
&ldquo;It will be the child who loves his country
the most who will carry the Stars and Stripes.
Try and do something for your country during
the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the children had been very busy ever since
doing all sorts of things that would show how
they loved their country.</p>

<p>Marjory had been knitting for soldiers. Her
grandmother had given her a pair of pretty yellow
needles and a ball of soft gray yarn and had
started a scarf. But the stitches would drop,
and there was still enough snow for sliding on
the hill back of Marjory&#8217;s house. Her knitting
was not much further along on Saturday than on
Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show how much I love my country,&rdquo;
Hubert said, and he asked his mother to take the
gilt buttons from his great-grandfather&#8217;s soldier
coat that hung in the attic and sew them on his
reefer. Then he showed the bright buttons to
all the other children, and they thought that
Hubert looked very fine indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall wear them when I carry the flag next
week,&rdquo; Hubert told them.</p>

<p>But the children thought that perhaps Roger
would be chosen as flag-bearer because he bought
such a large flag with the money in his bank,
and put it up on the flagpole in his front yard.
Roger&#8217;s father helped him raise the flag on a rope
so that he could pull it down at night, but once
the Stars and Stripes were flying Roger forgot
all about them. His flag stayed out in the wind
and sleet, and its bright colors faded and the
stripes were torn.</p>

<p>After all, the children decided, it would be
Edward who would carry the flag. Edward had
a dog named Trusty, and he decided to train him
to be a Red Cross dog. He put a white band with
a red cross on it around Trusty and harnessed
him to a little express wagon to carry bundles.
Trusty had never worn a harness in his life, or
been fastened to anything. He tried to get away
from the wagon, but Edward strapped the harness
more tightly. The straps hurt Trusty, and it
hurt his feelings to be made to drag the cart; but
Edward drove him to and from the drug-store
and the grocery and the butcher&#8217;s, carrying the
parcels that Edward had always brought alone
before.</p>

<p>The other children, too, all tried to do unusual
things to win themselves the place of flag-bearer.
They played their drums in the street and made
soldier caps and wooden swords and drilled. The
little girls dressed up and played army nurse with
their dolls. The boys bought toy soldiers and
horns at the toy shop. There was a great deal
of noise everywhere.</p>

<p>Then it was the holiday, and everyone was
greatly excited over what was going to happen.
Whoever had a red ribbon, or a blue necktie, or
a red-white-and-blue badge felt very proud indeed
to wear it. Every child sat as still as a mouse as
the teacher spoke to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marjory showed me five rows that she had
knitted for a soldier when I went to her house
a few days ago,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder how many
rows she has finished now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only five,&rdquo; Marjory said softly.</p>

<p>Hubert touched the buttons on his reefer and
sat up very straight in his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am wearing my great-grandfather&#8217;s soldier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
buttons,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ought to make you feel as brave as he
was, when he earned the right to wear them in
battle,&rdquo; the teacher said; and Hubert suddenly
thought that gilt buttons had not made him into
a soldier at all.</p>

<p>The other children began to think, too, as they
looked up at the Stars and Stripes at the end of
the room. Edward remembered how the harness
had hurt Trusty, and the boy with the drum remembered
how he had awakened the baby from
her nap. Roger thought of his torn flag, flapping
in the wind on the top of the flagpole. No one
said anything until the teacher looked at the end
of the class and smiled, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Peter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter smiled back, and tried to cover up the
holes in his jacket sleeves, and tucked his old
shoes under the seat. Peter&#8217;s father had gone to
be a soldier, and there were his mother, and the
two babies, and his grandfather who was blind,
at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing all the week,
Peter?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tending the babies so that mother could go
to the factory and sew the soldiers&#8217; uniforms,&rdquo;
Peter said. &ldquo;And leading grandfather out for
a walk when it was a sunny day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter&#8217;s got a little flag hanging out of the
window,&rdquo; one of the children said, &ldquo;and he&#8217;s so
careful of it. He takes it in every night and puts
it out again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He saluted the flag and took off his hat to it
when the parade went by the other day,&rdquo; said
another child. Everyone loved merry, ragged
Peter, who could play so gayly when he had time
for a game.</p>

<p>Just then they heard the band outside. It was
playing, &ldquo;The Red, White and Blue,&rdquo; the music
to which the children were to march with the
flag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shall be our flag-bearer?&rdquo; the teacher
asked.</p>

<p>The children knew now. They were quite sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>So Peter carried the Stars and Stripes across
the park and into the Town Hall, with all the
primary children marching like soldiers behind.
The wind blew it around him like a cloak to cover
up the holes in his jacket sleeves and his old
shoes. Wherever he looked he could see the
colors; the sky was as blue as the field in the
flag, a few snow stars lay on the ground and
the first robin redbreast sang on a branch over
his head. And the children following Peter knew
what the colors told them to do for their country&mdash;to
be brave, and good, and true at home.</p>

THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THORNTON W. BURGESS</strong></p>


<p>Old Mother West Wind had stopped to talk
with the Slender Fir Tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve just come across the Green Meadows,&rdquo;
said Old Mother West Wind, &ldquo;and there I saw
the Best Thing in the World.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Striped Chipmunk was sitting under the Slender
Fir Tree, and he couldn&#8217;t help hearing what Old
Mother West Wind said. &ldquo;The Best Thing in the
World&mdash;now what can that be?&rdquo; thought Striped
Chipmunk. &ldquo;Why, it must be heaps and heaps
of nuts and acorns! I&#8217;ll go and find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Striped Chipmunk started down the Lone
Little Path through the wood as fast as he could
run. Pretty soon he met Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going in such a hurry, Striped
Chipmunk?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best
Thing in the World,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk,
and ran faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; said Peter
Rabbit, &ldquo;why, that must be a great pile of carrots
and cabbage! I think I&#8217;ll go and find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Peter Rabbit started down the Lone Little
Path through the wood as fast as he could go
after Striped Chipmunk.</p>

<p>As they passed the great hollow tree Bobby
Coon put his head out. &ldquo;Where are you going in
such a hurry?&rdquo; asked Bobby Coon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best
Thing in the World!&rdquo; shouted Striped Chipmunk
and Peter Rabbit, and both began to run
faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; said Bobby
Coon to himself; &ldquo;why, that must be a whole
field of sweet milky corn. I think I&#8217;ll go and find
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bobby Coon climbed down out of the great
hollow tree and started down the Lone Little
Path through the wood as fast as he could go
after Striped Chipmunk and Peter Rabbit, for
there is nothing that Bobby Coon likes to eat so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
well as sweet milky corn.</p>

<p>At the edge of the wood they met Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going in such a hurry?&rdquo; asked
Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down in the Green Meadows to find the Best
Thing in the World!&rdquo; shouted Striped Chipmunk,
and Peter Rabbit, and Bobby Coon. Then they
all tried to run faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; said Jimmy
Skunk. &ldquo;Why, that must be packs and packs of
beetles!&rdquo; And for once in his life Jimmy Skunk
began to hurry down the Lone Little Path after
Striped Chipmunk, and Peter Rabbit, and Bobby
Coon.</p>

<p>They were all running so fast that they didn&#8217;t
see Reddy Fox until he jumped out of the long
grass and asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going in such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To find the Best Thing in the World!&rdquo; shouted
Striped Chipmunk, and Peter Rabbit, and Bobby
Coon, and Jimmy Skunk, and each did his best to
run faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; said Reddy
Fox to himself, &ldquo;why, that must be a whole pen
full of tender young chickens, and I must have
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So away went Reddy Fox as fast as he could
run down the Lone Little Path after Striped
Chipmunk, Peter Rabbit, Bobby Coon, and Jimmy
Skunk.</p>

<p>By-and-by they all came to the house of Johnny
Chuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going in such a hurry?&rdquo; asked
Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To find the Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; shouted
Striped Chipmunk, and Peter Rabbit, and Bobby
Coon, and Jimmy Skunk, and Reddy Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Best Thing in the World,&rdquo; said Johnny
Chuck. &ldquo;Why, I don&#8217;t know of anything better
than my own little home, and the warm sunshine,
and the beautiful blue sky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Johnny Chuck stayed at home and played all
day among the flowers with the Merry Little
Breezes of Old Mother West Wind, and was as
happy as could be.</p>

<p>But all day long Striped Chipmunk, and Peter
Rabbit, and Reddy Fox, and Bobby Coon, and
Jimmy Skunk, ran this way and ran that way over
the Green Meadows trying to find the Best Thing
in the World. The sun was very, very warm,
and they ran so far and ran so fast that they were
very, very hot and tired, and still they hadn&#8217;t
found the Best Thing in the World.</p>

<p>When the long day was over they started up
the Lone Little Path past Johnny Chuck&#8217;s house
to their own homes. They didn&#8217;t hurry now,
for they were so very, very tired! And they were
cross&mdash;oh, so cross!</p>

<p>Striped Chipmunk hadn&#8217;t found so much as the
leaf of a cabbage. Bobby Coon hadn&#8217;t found the
tiniest bit of sweet milky corn. Jimmy Skunk
hadn&#8217;t seen a single beetle. Reddy Fox hadn&#8217;t
heard so much as the peep of a chicken. And all
were hungry as hungry could be.</p>

<p>Half way up the Lone Little Path they met Old
Mother West Wind going to her home behind the
hill. &ldquo;Did you find the Best Thing in the World?&rdquo;
asked Old Mother West Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Striped Chipmunk, and Peter
Rabbit, and Bobby Coon, and Jimmy Skunk, and
Reddy Fox, all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny Chuck has it,&rdquo; said Old Mother West
Wind. &ldquo;It is being happy with the things you
have, and not wanting things which some one
else has. And it is called Con-tent-ment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MADGE A. BINGHAM</strong></p>


<p>It was the night before Thanksgiving in Peter
Pumpkin-eater&#8217;s garden. Great Big Pumpkin,
Middle-Sized Pumpkin, and Little Wee Pumpkin
were speaking together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All here?&rdquo; asked Great Big Pumpkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m here,&rdquo; answered Middle-Sized Pumpkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m here,&rdquo; answered Little Wee Pumpkin.
&ldquo;But I heard Peter say that he would pull us
to-morrow and send us away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be fine!&rdquo; said Great Big Pumpkin.
&ldquo;I hope we shall make good pies for some one&#8217;s
dinner. I wish we could go to the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Middle-Sized Pumpkin. &ldquo;Maybe
we could see the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see Cinderella,&rdquo; said Little
Wee Pumpkin. &ldquo;But I am not large enough to
go to the palace. Still, I wish I could make some
one glad on Thanksgiving Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Wee Pumpkin was the first to wake in
the morning. Peter had opened the garden gate,
and Cinderella was walking into the garden.</p>

<p>Little Wee Pumpkin opened her eyes and
listened.</p>

<p>Cinderella was beautiful, and Little Wee Pumpkin
knew that she was good and kind. She was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
carrying a basket full of yellow flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are for you, Peter,&rdquo; she said, laughing.
&ldquo;I have brought them from the palace garden.
They are for your Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must help me find the right pumpkin
for a jack-o&#8217;-lantern. It is to make a little girl
glad. She has been ill a long time, and must
have a jack-o&#8217;-lantern for Thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady,&rdquo; said Peter; and they went
from vine to vine.</p>

<p>First, they stopped at Great Big Pumpkin, but
that was too large. Then they stopped at Middle-Sized
Pumpkin, but that was too flat. Then
they stopped at Little Wee Pumpkin, and that
was just right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the pumpkin for the jack-o&#8217;-lantern,
Peter,&rdquo; she said, pointing to Little Wee Pumpkin.
&ldquo;This will make the little girl glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady,&rdquo; said Peter, as he pulled Little
Wee Pumpkin from the vine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two large pumpkins shall go to the palace,
to the King,&rdquo; said Cinderella. &ldquo;They will make
fine pies for his Thanksgiving dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lady,&rdquo; said Peter, as he pulled the two
pumpkins from the vines.</p>

<p>So Great Big, Middle-Sized, and Little Wee
all had their wishes.</p>

<h2><a name="KING" id="KING"></a>THE COMING OF THE KING<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY LAURA E. RICHARDS</strong></p>


<p>Some children were at play in their playground
one day when a herald rode through the town,
blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud: &ldquo;The King!
The King passes by this road to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;The King is
coming. He may look over the wall and see our
playground: who knows? We must put it in
order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The playground was sadly dirty, and in the
corners were scraps of paper and broken toys&mdash;for
these were careless children! But now, one
brought a hoe, and another a rake, and a third
ran to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the
garden gate. They labored hard, till at length all
was clean and tidy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is clean!&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;but we must
make it pretty, too, for kings are used to fine
things; maybe he would not notice mere cleanness,
for he may have it all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one brought sweet rushes and strewed
them on the ground; and others made garlands
of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on
the walls; and the littlest one pulled marigold
buds and threw them all about the playground.</p>

<p>When all was done the playground was so
beautiful that the children stood and looked at it,
and clapped their hands with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us keep it always like this!&rdquo; said the
littlest one; and the others cried: &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited all day for the coming of the
King, but he did not come; only, toward sunset,
a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired
face passed along the road, and stopped to look
over the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant place!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;May
I come in and rest, dear children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children brought him in gladly, and set him
on the seat that they had made out of an old
cask. They had covered it with an old red cloak,
to make it look like a throne; and it made a very
good one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our playground!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We made
it pretty for the King, but he did not come, and
now we mean to keep it so for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is good!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we think pretty and clean is nicer
than ugly and dirty!&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is better!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for tired people to rest in!&rdquo; said the
littlest one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is best of all!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>He sat and rested, and looked at the children
with such kind eyes that they came about him, and
told him all they knew; about the five puppies in
the barn, and the thrush&#8217;s nest with four blue
eggs, and the shore where the gold shells grew:
and the man nodded, and understood all about it.</p>

<p>By-and-by he asked for a cup of water, and
they brought it to him in the best cup, with the
gold sprigs on it, then he thanked the children,
and rose and went on his way; but before he went
he laid his hand on their heads for a moment, and
the touch went warm to their hearts.</p>

<p>The children stood by the wall and watched the
man as he went slowly along. The sun was setting,
and the light fell in long slanting rays across
the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks so tired!&rdquo; said one of the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was so kind!&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the littlest one. &ldquo;How the sun
shines on his hair! it looks like a crown of
gold.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE PIG<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MAUD LINDSAY</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time a little black-and-white pig
with a curly tail went out to take a morning walk.
He intended to go to the Mud Puddle, but before
he got there he came to a garden gate that was
stretched wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph, umph,&rdquo; said the little pig, when he saw
it; &ldquo;isn&#8217;t this fine? I have wanted to get into
this garden ever since I can remember.&rdquo; And in
he went as fast as his four short legs could carry
him.</p>

<p>The garden was full of flowers. There were
pansies, and daisies, and violets, and honeysuckles,
and all the bright flowers that you can name.
Everything was in the proper place. There were
tulips on either side of the garden walk, and
hollyhocks stood in a straight row against the
fence. The pansies had a garden bed all to themselves,
and the young vines were just beginning
to climb up on the frame that the gardener had
made for their special benefit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph, umph, nice place,&rdquo; said the little pig;
and he put his nose down in the pansy bed and
began to root up the pansies, for he thought that
was the way to behave in a garden.</p>

<p>While he was enjoying himself there the brown
hen came down the road with her family. She
had thirteen children, and she was looking for a
nice rich spot where they might scratch for their
breakfast. When she saw the open gate she was
delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cluck, cluck, come on,&rdquo; she said to her chicks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peep, peep, peep,&rdquo; said the little chickens, &ldquo;is
it a worm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful garden, and there is nothing
that I like better than to scratch in a garden,&rdquo;
answered the hen, as she bustled through the
gate. The chickens followed her, and soon they
were all busy scratching among the violets.</p>

<p>They had not been there very long when the
red cow walked by the garden. She was on her
way to the Pond, but when she saw the open garden
gate she decided at once to go in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moo, moo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is delightful. Tender
flowers are such a treat.&rdquo; And she swished
her tail over her back as she nipped the daisies
from their stems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cluck,&rdquo; said the hen, &ldquo;Peep,&rdquo; said the chicks,
&ldquo;Umph,&rdquo; said the little pig, for they were pleased
to have company. While they were talking a
rabbit with very bright eyes peeped in at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it a party?&rdquo; he said when he saw the
red cow, and the pig with a curly tail, and the
hen and chickens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the pig, &ldquo;and help yourself.
There is plenty of room.&rdquo; So the rabbit hopped
into the garden and nibbled the green leaves and
the young vines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of us are here?&rdquo; asked the red
cow, but before any of them could count, the
gardener came home.</p>

<p>When <em>he</em> looked into the garden he began to
cry: &ldquo;Oh, my pretty pansies! my dear daisies!
my sweet violets! my tender young vines!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he talking about?&rdquo; said the chickens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he wants us to go out,&rdquo; answered
the hen; and she ruffled her feathers and quarreled
as the gardener came hurrying toward
them.</p>

<p>Then the cow ran one way and the pig ran
another. The little chickens got lost in the
bushes, and the rabbit hid in the vines. The hen
cackled, and the pig squealed, and the gardener
scolded. By the time he had driven them all out
of the garden the sun was high in the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph, umph,&rdquo; cried the little pig, as he scampered
down the road, &ldquo;we will all come back
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they went back the next day the
garden gate was fastened close, and not even the
smallest chicken could get inside.</p>

<h2><a name="TRAVELS" id="TRAVELS"></a>THE TRAVELS OF THE LITTLE TOY SOLDIER</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY CAROLYN SHERWIN BAILEY</strong></p>


<p>He was the largest and the best dressed and
the bravest looking of all the toy soldiers in the
toy shop. Some of the toy soldiers were made of
paper, and these tore easily if they even tried
to drill. Some of the toy soldiers were made
of tin, and these bent if they had an encounter.</p>

<p>But this toy soldier, who stood head and shoulders
above the others, was made of wood. He had
once been part of a great pine tree that stood
in the forest, and his heart was as brave and true
as the heart of the tree.</p>

<p>His trousers were painted green, with yellow
stripes; and his jacket was painted red, with gold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
buttons. He wore a painted blue cap upon the
side of his head, with a band that went under his
chin, and he carried a wooden gun in one arm.
He could stand alone, for his wooden legs were
glued to a block of wood, and his eyes were black
and shining, and his mouth was painted in a
smile.</p>

<p>When the Toy Soldier went from the toy shop
to live in Gregory&#8217;s house the little boy thought
that he had never seen such a fine soldier in his
life. He made him captain of all the soldier
ninepins and guard of the toy train, and he took
him to bed with him at night. Then, one day,
James, who lived next door and was Gregory&#8217;s
neighbor, came over to play with Gregory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice Toy Soldier!&rdquo; James said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&#8217;s mine,&rdquo; Gregory said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I play with him?&rdquo; James asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I said he was my Toy Soldier,&rdquo; Gregory
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&#8217;ll take him,&rdquo; James said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t let you,&rdquo; Gregory said.</p>

<p>Then the two little boys began pulling the Toy
Soldier to see which could get him away from
the other, and the Toy Soldier did not like it
at all. He was fond of a good battle, but not
of a quarrel. He decided that he would not stay
in a house where there was a quarrelsome boy,
and so he tumbled out of a window that was
close by and fell, down, down, to the street
below.</p>

<p>The Toy Soldier had not lain long on the sidewalk
when Harold passed by and picked him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted a toy soldier and here is the finest
one I ever saw,&rdquo; Harold said; and he slipped
the soldier inside his coat and started on, for he
was going to school. The Toy Soldier lay close
to Harold&#8217;s watch that was tick, tick, ticking the
time away, but Harold loitered, and at last he
stopped to play a game of marbles with another
little boy whom he met. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t care if I am
late for school,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought the Toy Soldier, and as the
two little boys played he dropped out from under
Harold&#8217;s coat and into the gutter. When Harold
reached school, late, the Toy Soldier was gone.</p>

<p>Joe found the Toy Soldier in the gutter and
ran home with him to his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a Toy Soldier!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How brave he looks,&rdquo; said Joe&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day the Toy Soldier went
about with Joe and listened to what he said and
watched what he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t go to the grocer&#8217;s; I&#8217;m afraid of his
dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t put in that nail. I am afraid that the
hammer will slip and hit my finger.&rdquo; This was
what the Toy Soldier heard.</p>

<p>Then it was Joe&#8217;s bedtime, and the Toy Soldier
went upstairs with him to bed, but Joe cried all
the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m afraid of the dark!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>When Joe was asleep the Toy Soldier slipped
out of his hand and fell into a scrap basket. He
knew very well that he couldn&#8217;t stay with a child
who was a coward.</p>

<p>No one saw the Toy Soldier when the basket
was emptied in the morning. He went with the
scraps into a huge bag, and then into a wagon,
and then into a factory where men sorted the
cloth to make it into paper. One of these men
found the Toy Soldier and took him home to
his little boy, who was lame and had to stay alone
all day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it been a good day, John?&rdquo; his father
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; laughed John as he hugged the
Toy Soldier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have my supper ready just in time,&rdquo; his
father said, watching the soup bubbling in a shining
pot on the stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I cleaned a little and set the table,&rdquo; John
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has your back hurt you very much to-day?&rdquo;
asked his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little, but I don&#8217;t mind that,&rdquo; John said.
&ldquo;See how fine the Toy Soldier looks standing on
the table!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought the Toy Soldier, &ldquo;now I have
found a place where I can stay. Here is another
soldier, cheerful and willing to work, and brave!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="DUMPS" id="DUMPS"></a>WHAT HAPPENED TO DUMPS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY CAROLYN SHERWIN BAILEY</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there was a queer little elf
named Dumps, who lived all by himself in a dark
little house down in a valley. Ever since he
could remember, things had gone wrong with him.</p>

<p>He shivered in the cold and kicked the coal
bucket when the fire wouldn&#8217;t burn. He howled
when he stumbled over his own dinner pots that
he had left in the middle of the floor; and he
stood in his front door and scowled when other
happy elves went by without speaking to him.</p>

<p>He and his family had lived like that for years.
When any elf wanted to describe something very
sad he would say it was &ldquo;Down in the Dumps.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
And so Dumps went on without a single happy
day.</p>

<p>But suddenly the elves decided to give a party.
Oh, it was going to be a very jolly party indeed,
and Dumps heard about it. Almost every elf
who passed was whistling, or singing something
cheerful. And some of them carried their best
green suits to the Wood Fairy&#8217;s house to be
pressed. And when Dumps heard about the party,
he cried so loud because he knew he wouldn&#8217;t be
invited that the Wood Fairy heard him. The
noise disturbed her, and she went down to Dumps&#8217;
house to see what was the matter with him <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it, from the beginning, my
dear,&rdquo; she said to poor little Dumps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t see the sunshine!&rdquo; Dumps howled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you can&#8217;t,&rdquo; said the Wood Fairy.
&ldquo;Your windows are dirty. Get some nice spring
water in your little pail and wash them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dumps had never thought of doing that. When
he washed the windows the sunbeams streamed
in like a golden ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something else the matter?&rdquo; the Wood
Fairy asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fire won&#8217;t burn, even though I kick the
coal bucket every day,&rdquo; Dumps sobbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, try blowing the fire,&rdquo; the Wood Fairy
suggested.</p>

<p>Dumps had never thought of doing that. His
bellows were stiff, but he blew them very hard,
and&mdash;crackle&mdash;there was a nice bright fire, and
his kettle began to sing!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the Wood Fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Dumps sighed, &ldquo;The other elves are
giving a party, and I&#8217;m not invited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for all the elves, and you don&#8217;t have to be
invited,&rdquo; the Wood Fairy said. &ldquo;Stand up straight
and let me brush your suit. Now run along, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dumps started up the hill to the party,
laughing all the way, for he just couldn&#8217;t help it.
You see, he had so many years of being one of
the Dumps to make up for! He laughed until
all his wrinkles were gone, and he was puffed
out with happiness. He started bees buzzing, and
grasshoppers fiddling, and crickets chirping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can this new, fat, cheerful elf be?&rdquo;
asked all the other elves, as Dumps arrived at
the party, turning a double-somersault into their
midst. &ldquo;We are all here except Dumps, and of
course this isn&#8217;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dumps showed them how he could turn
back-somersaults, and make a see-saw out of a
rush leaf. He taught them how to play baseball
with white clover heads, and how to make a swing
of braided grasses. He surprised himself with
all the good times he was able to think up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, this isn&#8217;t Dumps,&rdquo; the other elves
decided. &ldquo;His name must be Delight.&rdquo; And
Dumps never told them their mistake, for it
wasn&#8217;t really a mistake at all. Now, was it?</p>

<h2>THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</strong></p>


<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
It was the schooner Hesperus,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sailed the wintry sea;</span><br />
And the skipper had taken his little daughter,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bear him company.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her cheeks like the dawn of day,</span><br />
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ope in the month of May.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
The skipper he stood beside the helm,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His pipe was in his mouth;</span><br />
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The smoke now west, now south.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Then up and spake an old Sailor,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had sailed to the Spanish Main:</span><br />
"I pray thee, put into yonder port,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I fear a hurricane.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
&ldquo;Last night, the moon had a golden ring,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to-night no moon we see!&rdquo;</span><br />
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a scornful laugh laughed he.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Colder and louder blew the wind,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A gale from the northeast,</span><br />
The snow fell hissing in the brine,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the billows frothed like yeast.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Down came the storm, and smote amain,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vessel in its strength;</span><br />
She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then leaped her cable&#8217;s length.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
&ldquo;Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And do not tremble so;</span><br />
For I can weather the roughest gale,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That ever wind did blow.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
He wrapped her warm in his seaman&#8217;s coat<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the stinging blast;</span><br />
He cut a rope from a broken spar,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bound her to the mast.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
&ldquo;O father! I hear the church-bells ring,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh say, what may it be?&rdquo;</span><br />
&ldquo;&#8217;Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he steered for the open sea.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
&ldquo;O father! I hear the sound of guns.<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh say, what may it be?&rdquo;</span><br />
&ldquo;Some ship in distress, that cannot live<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In such an angry sea!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
&ldquo;O father! I see a gleaming light.<br />

But the father answered never a word,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A frozen corpse was he.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his face turned to the skies,</span><br />
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his fixed and glassy eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That saved she might be;</span><br />
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the Lake of Galilee.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
And fast through the midnight dark and drear,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the whistling sleet and snow,</span><br />
Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toward the reef of Norman&#8217;s Woe.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
And ever the fitful gusts between<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sound came from the land;</span><br />
It was the sound of the trampling surf,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
The breakers were right beneath her bows,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She drifted a dreary wreck,</span><br />
And a whooping billow swept the crew<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like icicles from her deck.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
She struck where the white and fleecy waves<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looked soft as carded wool,</span><br />
But the cruel rocks, they gored her side<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the horns of an angry bull.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the masts went by the board;</span><br />
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ho! ho! the breakers roared!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A fisherman stood aghast,</span><br />
To see the form of a maiden fair,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lashed close to a drifting mast.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
The salt sea was frozen on her breast,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The salt tears in her eyes;</span><br />
And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the billows fall and rise.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the midnight and the snow!</span><br />
Christ save us all from a death like this,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the reef of Norman&#8217;s Woe.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
It was a little, little page,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was brought from far away,</span><br />
To bear the great queen&#8217;s velvet train<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon her bridal day.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
His yellow curls were long and bright,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His page&#8217;s suit was blue,</span><br />
With golden clasps at neck and knee,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ruffles fair and new.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And faith, he was the smallest page<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The court had ever known:</span><br />
His head scarce reached the topmost step<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That led up to the throne.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And oh, &#8217;t was but a little lad<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had never been before</span><br />
So many leagues from kin and friends,<br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who never yet, I wis,</span><br />
Had stolen lonely to his bed<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without his mother&#8217;s kiss.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
He had not seen the noble queen,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of whom his heart had fear;</span><br />
He knew no friend at court to give<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A welcome and good cheer.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
It was the busy night before<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great queen&#8217;s wedding-day,</span><br />
And all was bustle, haste, and noise,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every one was gay;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And each one had his task to do,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And none had time to spare</span><br />
To tend a weeping little page<br />

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Far in a big and gloomy room<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the castle keep,</span><br />
The little page lay all alone,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wept, and could not sleep.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
The little page lay all alone,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hid his head and cried,</span><br />
Until it seemed his aching heart<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would burst his little side.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
The chamber door was set ajar,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one was passing by</span><br />
Who heard the little page&#8217;s sobs<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then his piteous cry.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Then some one lifted up the latch<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pushed the heavy door,</span><br />
And then a lady entered in<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And crossed the chamber floor&mdash;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
A lady tall and sweet and fair,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In bridal white who stepped;</span><br />

 <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wished he had not come;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
For she was &ldquo;such a proud, great queen&rdquo;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was afraid, he said;</span><br />
And he was &ldquo;lost and lonely&rdquo; there<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that huge, gloomy bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And then the lady bent her down<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kissed him on the lips,</span><br />

The tears stood in her gentle eyes;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;Poor little lad!&rdquo; she said,</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knelt down by the bed.</span></p>

They clad him in a suit of white,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With velvet cap and cloak,</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And crystal buckles on his shoes,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And led him to the queen,</span><br />
All lovely in her bridal gear,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest ever seen.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And he was such a tiny page,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trembled and looked down,</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great queen sternly frown.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
But lo! he heard a soft voice say,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&ldquo;O little page, look here!</span><br />
Am I, who sing to sleep so well,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A queen for child to fear?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
He raised his eyes, and lo! the bride<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looked on the page and smiled,</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">At nurse-maid for a child.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">

<h2><a name="IMAGE" id="IMAGE"></a>THE SNOW-IMAGE</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</strong></p>


<p>One afternoon of a cold winter&#8217;s day, when
the sun shone forth with chilly brightness, after
a long storm, two children asked leave of their
mother to run out and play in the new-fallen
snow.</p>

<p>The elder child was a little girl, whom, because
she was of a tender and modest disposition,
and was thought to be very beautiful, her
parents and other people who were familiar with
her used to call Violet.</p>

<p>But her brother was known by the title of
Peony, on account of the ruddiness of his broad
and round little phiz, which made everybody
think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Violet&mdash;yes, my little Peony,&rdquo; said their
kind mother; &ldquo;you may go and play in the snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-and-jump
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that carried them at once into
the very heart of a huge snowdrift, whence Violet
emerged like a snow bunting, while little
Peony floundered out with his round face in
full bloom.</p>

<p>Then what a merry time had they! To look
at them frolicking in the wintry garden, you
would have thought that the dark and pitiless
storm had been sent for no other purpose but
to provide a new plaything for Violet and
Peony; and that they themselves had been created,
as the snowbirds were, to take delight only
in the tempest and in the white mantle which it
spread over the earth.</p>

<p>At last, when they had frosted one another
all over with handfuls of snow, Violet, after
laughing heartily at little Peony&#8217;s figure, was
struck with a new idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;if your cheeks were not so red. And
that puts me in mind! Let us make an image
out of snow&mdash;an image of a little girl&mdash;and it
shall be our sister, and shall run about and
play with us all winter long. Won&#8217;t it be nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Peony, as plainly as he could
speak, for he was but a little boy. &ldquo;That will be
nice! And mamma shall see it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Violet; &ldquo;mamma shall see the
new little girl. But she must not make her come
into the warm parlor, for, you know, our little
snow-sister will not love the warmth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And forthwith the children began this great
business of making a snow-image that should
run about; while their mother, who was sitting at
the window and overheard some of their talk,
could not help smiling at the gravity with which
they set about it. They really seemed to imagine
that there would be no difficulty whatever in
creating a live little girl out of the snow.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight&mdash;those
bright little souls at their tasks. Moreover,
it was really wonderful to observe how
knowingly and skillfully they managed the matter.
Violet assumed the chief direction and told
Peony what to do, while, with her own delicate
fingers, she shaped out all the nicer parts of the
snow-figure.</p>

<p>It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by
the children, as to grow up under their hands,
while they were playing and prattling about it.
Their mother was quite surprised at this; and
the longer she looked, the more and more surprised
she grew.</p>

<p>Now, for a few moments there was a busy
and earnest but indistinct hum of the two children&#8217;s
voices, as Violet and Peony wrought together
with one happy consent. Violet still
seemed to be the guiding spirit; while Peony
acted rather as a laborer and brought her the
snow from far and near. And yet the little
urchin evidently had a proper understanding of
the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peony, Peony!&rdquo; cried Violet; for her brother
was at the other side of the garden. &ldquo;Bring me
those light wreaths of snow that have rested
on the lower branches of the pear tree. You
can clamber on the snowdrift, Peony, and reach
them easily. I must have them to make some
ringlets for our snow-sister&#8217;s head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are, Violet!&rdquo; answered the little
boy. &ldquo;Take care you do not break them. Well
done! Well done! How pretty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she not look sweet?&rdquo; said Violet, with a
very satisfied tone; &ldquo;and now we must have
some little shining bits of ice to make the brightness
of her eyes. She is not finished yet. Mamma
will see how very beautiful she is; but papa
will say, &lsquo;Tush! nonsense! come in out of the
cold!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us call mamma to look out,&rdquo; said Peony;
and then he shouted, &ldquo;Mamma! mamma!! mamma!!!
Look out and see what a nice &#8217;ittle girl
we are making!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice playmate she will be for us all
winter long!&rdquo; said Violet. &ldquo;I hope papa will
not be afraid of her giving us a cold! Shan&#8217;t
you love her dearly, Peony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Peony. &ldquo;And I will hug her
and she shall sit down close by me and drink
some of my warm milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Peony!&rdquo; answered Violet, with grave
wisdom. &ldquo;That will not do at all. Warm milk
will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister.
Little snow-people, like her, eat nothing but
icicles. No, no, Peony; we must not give her
anything warm to drink!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a minute or two of silence; for
Peony, whose short legs were never weary, had
gone again to the other side of the garden. All
of a sudden, Violet cried out, loudly and joyfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Peony! Come quickly! A light
has been shining on her cheek out of that rose-colored
cloud! And the color does not go away!
Is not that beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is beau-ti-ful,&rdquo; answered Peony, pronouncing
the three syllables with deliberate accuracy.
&ldquo;O Violet, only look at her hair! It is
all like gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Violet, as if it were very
much a matter of course. &ldquo;That color, you
know, comes from the golden clouds that we see
up there in the sky. She is almost finished now.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
But her lips must be made very red&mdash;redder than
her cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it will make them
red if we both kiss them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, the mother heard two smart little
smacks, as if both her children were kissing the
snow-image on its frozen mouth. But as this did
not seem to make the lips quite red enough, Violet
next proposed that the snow-child should be
invited to kiss Peony&#8217;s scarlet cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, &#8217;ittle snow-sister, kiss me!&rdquo; cried
Peony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! she has kissed you,&rdquo; added Violet,
&ldquo;and now her lips are very red. And she blushed
a little, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a cold kiss!&rdquo; cried Peony.</p>

<p>Just then there came a breeze of the pure west
wind sweeping through the garden, and rattling
the parlor windows. It sounded so wintry cold
that the mother was about to tap on the window-pane
with her thimbled finger to summon the
two children in when they both cried out to her
with one voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma! mamma! We have finished our
little snow-sister, and she is running about the
garden with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What imaginative little beings my children
are!&rdquo; thought the mother, putting the last few
stitches into Peony&#8217;s frock. &ldquo;And it is strange,
too, that they make me almost as much a child
as they themselves are! I can hardly help believing
now that the snow-image has really come
to life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear mamma!&rdquo; cried Violet, &ldquo;pray look out
and see what a sweet playmate we have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother, being thus entreated, could no
longer delay to look forth from the window. The
sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving, however,
a rich inheritance of his brightness among
those purple and golden clouds which make the
sunsets of winter so magnificent.</p>

<p>But there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle,
either on the window or on the snow; so that
the good lady could look all over the garden and
see everything and everybody in it. And what do
you think she saw there? Violet and Peony, of
course, her own two darling children.</p>

<p>Ah, but whom or what did she see besides?
Why, if you will believe me, there was a small
figure of a girl, dressed all in white, with rose-tinged
cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing
about the garden with the two children!</p>

<p>A stranger though she was, the child seemed
to be on as familiar terms with Violet and Peony,
and they with her, as if all the three had been
playmates during the whole of their little lives.</p>

<p>The mother thought to herself that it must
certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors,
and that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden,
the child had run across the street to play with
them.</p>

<p>So this kind lady went to the door, intending
to invite the little runaway into her comfortable
parlor; for, now that the sunshine was withdrawn,
the atmosphere out of doors was already
growing very cold.</p>

<p>But, after opening the house door, she stood
an instant on the threshold, hesitating whether
she ought to ask the child to come in, or whether
she should even speak to her. Indeed, she almost
doubted whether it were a real child after
all, or only a light wreath of the new-fallen snow,
blown hither and thither about the garden by the
intensely cold west wind.</p>

<p>There was certainly something very singular
in the aspect of the little stranger. Among all
the children of the neighborhood the lady could
remember no such face, with its pure white and
delicate rose-color, and the golden ringlets tossing
about the forehead and cheeks.</p>

<p>And as for her dress, which was entirely of
white, and fluttering in the breeze, it was such
as no reasonable woman would put upon a little
girl when sending her out to play in the depth of
winter. It made this kind and careful mother
shiver only to look at those small feet, with
nothing in the world on them except a very thin
pair of white slippers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, airily as she was clad, the child
seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience
from the cold, but danced so lightly over the snow
that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its
surface; while Violet could but just keep pace
with her, and Peony&#8217;s short legs compelled him
to lag behind.</p>

<p>All this while, the mother stood on the threshold,
wondering how a little girl could look so
much like a flying snowdrift, or how a snowdrift
could look so very like a little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Violet, my darling, what is this child&#8217;s name?&rdquo;
asked she. &ldquo;Does she live near us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, dearest mamma,&rdquo; answered Violet, laughing
to think that her mother did not comprehend
so very plain an affair, &ldquo;this is our little snow-sister
whom we have just been making!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear mamma,&rdquo; cried Peony, running to
his mother and looking up simply into her face.
&ldquo;This is our snow-image! Is it not a nice &#8217;ittle
child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; said her mother, greatly perplexed,
&ldquo;tell me the truth without any jest. Who is this
little girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling mamma,&rdquo; answered Violet, looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
seriously into her mother&#8217;s face, surprised
that she should need any further explanation,
&ldquo;I have told you truly who she is. It is our
little snow-image which Peony and I have been
making. Peony will tell you so, as well as I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mamma,&rdquo; asseverated Peony, with much
gravity in his crimson little phiz; &ldquo;this is &#8217;ittle
snow-child. Is not she a nice one? But, mamma,
her hand is, oh, so very cold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While mamma still hesitated what to think
and what to do, the street gate was thrown open
and the father of Violet and Peony appeared,
wrapped in a pilot-cloth sack, with a fur cap
drawn down over his ears, and the thickest of
gloves upon his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsey was a middle-aged man, with a
weary and yet a happy look in his wind-flushed
and frost-pinched face, as if he had been busy all
the day long and was glad to get back to his quiet
home. His eyes brightened at the sight of his
wife and children, although he could not help
uttering a word or two of surprise at finding the
whole family in the open air on so bleak a day,
and after sunset, too.</p>

<p>He soon perceived the little white stranger,
sporting to and fro in the garden like a dancing
snow-wreath, and the flock of snowbirds fluttering
about her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, what little girl may that be?&rdquo; inquired
this very sensible man. &ldquo;Surely her mother
must be crazy to let her go out in such bitter
weather as it has been to-day, with only that
flimsy white gown and those thin slippers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear husband,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;I know
no more about the little thing than you do.
Some neighbor&#8217;s child, I suppose. Our Violet
and Peony,&rdquo; she added, laughing at herself for
repeating so absurd a story, &ldquo;insist that she is
nothing but a snow-image which they have been
busy about in the garden almost all the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes
toward the spot where the children&#8217;s snow-image
had been made. What was her surprise on perceiving
that there was not the slightest trace of
so much labor!&mdash;no image at all!&mdash;no piled-up
heap of snow!&mdash;nothing whatever save the
prints of little footsteps around a vacant space!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very strange!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is strange, dear mother?&rdquo; asked Violet.
&ldquo;Dear father, do not you see how it is?
This is our snow-image, which Peony and I
have made because we wanted another playmate.
Did not we, Peony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; said crimson Peony. &ldquo;This be
our &#8217;ittle snow-sister. Is she not beau-ti-ful?
But she gave me such a cold kiss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poh, nonsense, children!&rdquo; cried their good,
honest father, who had a plain matter-of-fact
way of looking at matters. &ldquo;Do not tell me of
making live figures out of snow. Come, wife;
this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak
air a moment longer. We will bring her into
the parlor; and you shall give her a supper of
warm bread and milk, and make her as comfortable
as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, this honest and very kind-hearted
man was going toward the little white damsel,
with the best intentions in the world. But Violet
and Peony, each seizing their father by the
hand, earnestly besought him not to make her
come in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, children, nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo;
cried the father, half-vexed, half-laughing. &ldquo;Run
into the house, this moment! It is too late to
play any longer now. I must take care of this
little girl, or she will catch her death-a-cold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, with a most benevolent smile, this
very well-meaning gentleman took the snow-child
by the hand and led her toward the house.</p>

<p>She followed them, droopingly and reluctant,
for all the glow and sparkle were gone out of
her figure; and whereas just before she had resembled
a bright, frosty, star-gemmed evening,
with a crimson gleam on the cold horizon, she
now looked as dull and languid as a thaw.</p>

<p>As kind Mr. Lindsey led her up the steps of
the door, Violet and Peony looked into his face,
their eyes full of tears, which froze before they
could run down their cheeks, and entreated him
not to bring their snow-image into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not bring her in!&rdquo; exclaimed the kind-hearted
man. &ldquo;Why, you are crazy, my little
Violet&mdash;quite crazy, my small Peony! She is so
cold already that her hand has almost frozen
mine, in spite of my thick gloves. Would you
have her freeze to death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife, as he came up the steps, had been
taking another long, earnest gaze at the little
white stranger. She hardly knew whether it
was a dream or no; but she could not help fancying
that she saw the delicate print of Violet&#8217;s
fingers on the child&#8217;s neck. It looked just as if,
while Violet was shaping out the image, she had
given it a gentle pat with her hand, and had
neglected to smooth the impression quite away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, husband,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;after
all, she does look strangely like a snow-image!
I do believe she is made of snow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A puff of the west wind blew against the snow-child,
and again she sparkled like a star.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snow!&rdquo; repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold.
&ldquo;No wonder she looks like snow. She is half
frozen, poor little thing! But a good fire will
put everything to rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The common-sensible man placed the snow-child
on the hearthrug, right in front of the hissing
and fuming stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now she will be comfortable!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Lindsey, rubbing his hands and looking about
him, with the pleasantest smile you ever saw.
&ldquo;Make yourself at home, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sad, sad and drooping, looked the little white
maiden as she stood on the hearthrug, with the
hot blast of the stove striking through her like a
pestilence. Once she threw a glance toward the
window, and caught a glimpse, through its red
curtains, of the snow-covered roofs and the
stars glimmering frostily and all the delicious
intensity of the cold night. The bleak wind
rattled the window panes as if it were summoning
her to come forth. But there stood the
snow-child, drooping, before the hot stove!</p>

<p>But the common-sensible man saw nothing
amiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let her have a pair of
thick stockings and a woolen shawl or blanket
directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm
supper as soon as the milk boils. You, Violet
and Peony, amuse your little friend. She is out
of spirits, you see, at finding herself in a strange
place. For my part, I will go around among
the neighbors and find out where she belongs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother, meanwhile, had gone in search
of the shawl and stockings. Without heeding the
remonstrances of his two children, who still kept
murmuring that their little snow-sister did not
love the warmth, good Mr. Lindsey took his departure,
shutting the parlor door carefully behind
him.</p>

<p>Turning up the collar of his sack over his
ears, he emerged from the house, and had barely
reached the street-gate when he was recalled by
the screams of Violet and Peony and the rapping
of a thimbled finger against the parlor window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband! husband!&rdquo; cried his wife, showing
her horror-stricken face through the window
panes. &ldquo;There is no need of going for the
child&#8217;s parents!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We told you so, father!&rdquo; screamed Violet and
Peony, as he re-entered the parlor. &ldquo;You would
bring her in; and now our poor&mdash;dear&mdash;beau-ti-ful
little snow-sister is thawed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And their own sweet little faces were already
dissolved in tears; so that their father, seeing
what strange things occasionally happen in this
everyday world, felt not a little anxious lest his
children might be going to thaw, too. In the
utmost perplexity, he demanded an explanation
of his wife.</p>

<p>She could only reply that, being summoned to
the parlor by the cries of Violet and Peony, she
found no trace of the little white maiden, unless
it were the remains of a heap of snow which,
while she was gazing at it, melted quite away
upon the hearthrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there you see all that is left of it!&rdquo; added
she, pointing to a pool of water in front of the
stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Violet, looking reproachfully
at him through her tears, &ldquo;there is all that
is left of our dear little snow-sister!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Peony, stamping his foot, and&mdash;I
shudder to say&mdash;shaking his little fist at the
common-sensible man. &ldquo;We told you how it
would be. What for did you bring her in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the stove, through the isinglass of its
door, seemed to glare at good Mr. Lindsey, like
a red-eyed demon triumphing in the mischief
which it had done!</p>

<h2><a name="GEMS" id="GEMS"></a>THE CASTLE OF GEMS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY SOPHIE MAY</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time, though I cannot tell when,
and in what country I do not now remember,
there lived a maiden as fair as a lily, as gentle
as a dewdrop, and as modest as a violet. A
pure, sweet name she had: It was Blanche.</p>

<p>She stood one evening, with her friend Victor,
by the shore of a lake. Never had the youth or
maiden seen the moonlight so enchanting; but
they did not know&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;It was midsummer day,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When all the fairy people</span><br />
From elf-land came away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently, while they gazed at the lake, which
shone like liquid emerald and sapphire and topaz,
a boat, laden with strangely beautiful beings,
glided toward them across the waters. The
fair voyagers were clad in robes of misty blue,
with white mantles about their waists, and on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
their heads wreaths of valley-lilies.</p>

<p>They were all as fair as need be; but fairest
of all was the helms-woman, the Queen of the
Fairies. Her face was soft and clear like moonlight;
and she wore a crown of nine large diamonds,
which refracted the evening rays, and
formed nine lunar rainbows.</p>

<p>The fairies were singing a roundelay; and,
as the melody floated over the water, Victor and
Blanche listened with throbbing hearts. Fairy
music has almost passed away from the earth;
but those who hear it are strangely moved, and
have dreams of beautiful things which have been,
and may be again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes me think of the days of long ago
when there was no sin,&rdquo; whispered Blanche.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes me long to be a hero,&rdquo; answered
Victor with a sparkling eye.</p>

<p>All the while the pearly boat was drifting
toward the youth and maiden; and, when it had
touched the shore the Queen stepped out upon
the land as lightly as if she had been made entirely
of dewdrops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Fontana,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;and is this
Blanche?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid her soft hand upon the maiden&#8217;s
shoulder; and Blanche thought she would like to
die then and there, so full was she of joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of thy good heart, my maiden:
now what would please thee most?&rdquo; inquired the
Queen.</p>

<p>Blanche bowed her head, and dared not speak.</p>

<p>Queen Fontana smiled. When she smiled it
was as if a soft cloud had slid away from the
moon, revealing a beautiful light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say pearls and diamonds,&rdquo; said Victor in her
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; whispered Blanche; &ldquo;they
are not the best things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Queen kindly; &ldquo;pearls and diamonds
are <em>not</em> the best things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Blanche knew that her whisper had been
overheard, and she hid her face in her hands for
shame. But the Queen only smiled down on her,
and without speaking dropped into the ground a
little seed. Right at the feet of Blanche it fell;
and in a moment two green leaves shot upward,
and between them a spotless lily, which hung its
head with modest grace.</p>

<p>Victor gazed at the perfect flower in wonder,
and before he knew it said aloud: &ldquo;Ah, how like
Blanche!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen herself broke it from the stem,
and gave it to the maiden, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it! It is my choicest gift. Till it fades
(which will never be), love will be thine; and
in time to come it will have power to open the
strongest locks, and swing back the heaviest
doors.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Gates of brass cannot withstand<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">One touch of this magic wand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Blanche looked up to thank the Queen; but
no words came&mdash;only tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a wish in thine eyes,&rdquo; said Fontana.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for Victor,&rdquo; faltered Blanche, at last;
&ldquo;he wishes to be rich and great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen looked grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I make him one of the great men of
the earth, little Blanche? Then he may one day
go to the ends of the world, and forget thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blanche only smiled, and Victor&#8217;s cheek flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be a great man,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps a
prince; but where I go Blanche shall go: she will
be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Never forget
Blanche, for her love will be your dearest
blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, removing from her girdle a pair of
spectacles, she placed them in the youth&#8217;s hand.
He drew back in surprise. &ldquo;Does she take me
for an old man?&rdquo; thought he. He had expected
a casket of gems at least; perhaps a crown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Fontana; &ldquo;they are the eyes of
Wisdom. When you have learned their use, you
will not despise my gift. Keep a pure heart, and
always remember Blanche. And now farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she moved on to the boat, floating
over the ground as softly as a creeping mist.</p>

<p>When Blanche awoke next morning, her first
thought was, &ldquo;Happy are the maidens who have
sweet dreams!&rdquo; for she believed she had only
been wandering in a midsummer&#8217;s night&#8217;s dream;
so, when she saw her lily in the broken pitcher
where she had placed it, great was her delight.
But a change had come over it during the night.
It was no longer a common lily; its petals were
now large pearls, and the green leaves were green
emeralds. This strange thing had happened to
the flower, that it might never fade.</p>

<p>After this, people looked at Blanche and said:
&ldquo;How is it? She grows fairer every day!&rdquo; And
every one loved her; for the human heart has
no choice but to love what is good and gentle.</p>

<p>As for Victor, he at first put on his spectacles
with a scornful smile; but, when he had worn
them a moment, he found them very wonderful
things. When he looked through them, he could
see people&#8217;s thoughts written out on their faces;
he could easily decipher the fine writing which
you see traced on green leaves; and found there
were long stories written on pebbles in little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
black and gray dots.</p>

<p>When he wore the spectacles, he looked so wise
that Blanche hardly dared speak to him. She
saw that one day he was to become great.</p>

<p>At last Victor said he must leave his home,
and sail across the seas. Tears filled the eyes
of Blanche; but the youth whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going away to find a home for you and
me. So adieu, dearest Blanche!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Victor thought the ship in which he
sailed moved very slowly; for he longed to reach
the land which he could see through his magic
spectacles. It was a beautiful kingdom, rich
with mines of gold and silver.</p>

<p>When the ship touched shore, the streets were
lined with people who walked to and fro with
sad faces. The King&#8217;s daughter, a beautiful
young maiden, was very ill, and it was feared
she must die.</p>

<p>Victor asked one of the people if there was no
hope.</p>

<p>It so happened that this man was the greatest
physician in the kingdom and he answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, there is no hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Victor went to a distant forest where
he knew a healing spring was to be found. Very
few remembered it was there; and those who
had seen it did not know of its power to heal
disease.</p>

<p>Victor filled a crystal goblet with the precious
water and carried it to the palace. The old
King shook his head sadly, but consented to let
the attendants moisten the parched lips of the
Princess with the water, as it could do no harm.
Far from doing harm, it wrought a great good;
and in time the royal maiden was restored to
health.</p>

<p>Then, for gratitude, the King would have given
his daughter to Victor for a wife; but Victor
remembered Blanche, and knew that no other
maiden must be bride of his.</p>

<p>Not long after this the King was lost overboard
at sea during a storm. Now the people
must have a new ruler. They determined to
choose a wise and brave man; and, young as he
was, no man could be found braver and wiser
than Victor; so the people elected him for their
King. Thus Fontana&#8217;s gift of the eyes of Wisdom
had made him truly &ldquo;one of the great men
of earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In her humble home Blanche dreamed every
night of Victor, and hoped he would grow good,
if he did not become great; and Victor remembered
Blanche, and knew that her love was his
dearest blessing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This old palace,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;will never do
for my beautiful bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he called together his people, and told
them he must have a castle of gems. Some of
the walls were to be of rubies, some of emeralds,
some of pearls. There was to be any amount
of beaten gold for doors and pillars; and the
ceilings were to be of milk-white opals, with a
rosy light which comes and goes.</p>

<p>All was done as he desired; and when the
castle of gems was finished it would need a pen
of jasponyx dipped in rainbows to describe it.</p>

<p>Victor thought he would not have a guard of
soldiers for his castle, but would lock the four
golden gates with a magic key, so that no one
could enter unless the gates should swing back
of their own accord.</p>

<p>When the castle of gems was just completed,
and not a soul was in it, Victor locked the gates
with a magic key, and then dropped the key into
the ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I have done a wise thing.
None but the good and true can enter my castle
of gems. The gates will not swing open for
men with base thoughts or proud hearts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he hid himself under the shadow of a
tree, and watched the people trying to enter.
But they were proud men, and so the gates would
not open.</p>

<p>King Victor laughed, and said to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done a wise thing with my magic key.
How safe I shall be in my castle of gems!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he stepped out of his hiding place, and
said to the people:</p>

<p>&ldquo;None but the good and true can get in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he tried to go in himself; but the gates
would not move.</p>

<p>The King bowed his head in shame, and walked
back to his old palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;wise and great
as I am, I thought I could go in. I see it must
be because I am filled with pride. Let me hide
my face; for what would Blanche say if she
knew, that, because my heart is proud, I am shut
out of my own castle? I am not worthy that
she should love me; but I hope I shall learn of
her to be humble and good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day he sailed for the home of his
childhood. When Blanche saw him she blushed
and cast down her eyes; but Victor knew they
were full of tears of joy. He held her hand,
and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go with me and be my bride, beautiful
Blanche?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; she answered softly; and
Victor&#8217;s heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>All the while Blanche never dreamed that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
was a great Prince, and that the men who came
with him were his courtiers.</p>

<p>When they reached Victor&#8217;s kingdom, and
the people shouted &ldquo;Long live the Queen!&rdquo;
Blanche veiled her face and trembled; for Victor
whispered in her ear that the shouts were for
her. And as the people saw her beautiful face
through her gossamer veil, they cried all the
more loudly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live Queen Blanche! Thrice welcome,
fair lady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west, and his rays
fell with dazzling splendor upon the castle of
gems. When Blanche saw the silent, closed
castle and its golden gates she remembered the
words of Queen Fontana, who had said that
her lily should have power to &ldquo;open the strongest
locks, and swing back the heaviest doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like one walking in a dream, she led Victor
toward the resplendent castle. She touched
with her lily the lock which fastened one of the
gates.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Gates of gold could not withstand<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .5em;">One touch of that magic wand.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>In an instant, the hinges trembled; and the
massive door swung open so far that forty
people could walk in side by side. Then it
slowly closed, and locked itself without noise.</p>

<p>One of the people who passed in was the
King, whose heart was no longer proud. The
others, who had entered unwittingly, could not
speak for wonder. Some of them were poor,
and some were lame or blind; but all were good
and true.</p>

<p>At the rising of the moon a wonderful thing
came to pass. The people entered the castle of
gems and became beautiful. This was through
the power of the magic lily.</p>

<p>Now there were no more crooked backs, and
lame feet, and sightless eyes; and the King
looked at these people, who were beautiful as
well as good, and declared he would have them
live in the castle; and the gentlemen should be
knights; and the ladies maids of honor.</p>

<p>To this day Victor and Blanche rule the kingdom;
and such is the charm of the lily&mdash;so like
the pure heart of the Queen&mdash;that the people are
becoming gentle and good.</p>

<p>Until Queen Fontana shall call for the magic
spectacles and the lily of pearl, it is believed that
Victor and Blanche will live in the castle of
gems, though the time should be a hundred years.</p>

<h2><a name="HEN" id="HEN"></a>THE HEN THAT HATCHED DUCKS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HARRIET BEECHER STOWE</strong></p>


<p>Once there was a nice young hen that we will
call Mrs. Feathertop. She was a hen of most
excellent family, being a direct descendant of the
Bolton Grays, and as pretty a young fowl as you
wish to see of a summer&#8217;s day. She was, moreover,
as fortunately situated in life as it was
possible for a hen to be. She was bought by
young Master Fred Little John, with four or
five family connections of hers, and a lively
young cock, who was held to be as brisk a
scratcher and as capable a head of a family as
any half-dozen sensible hens could desire.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that at first Mrs. Feathertop was a
very sensible hen. She was very pretty and
lively, to be sure, and a great favorite with
Master Bolton Gray Cock, on account of her
bright eyes, her finely shaded feathers, and certain
saucy dashing ways that she had, which
seemed greatly to take his fancy. But old Mrs.
Scratchard, living in the neighboring yard, assured
all the neighborhood that Gray Cock was a
fool for thinking so much of that flighty young
thing&mdash;that she had not the smallest notion how
to get on in life, and thought of nothing in the
world but her own pretty feathers. &ldquo;Wait till
she comes to have chickens,&rdquo; said Mrs. Scratchard.
&ldquo;Then you will see. I have brought up
ten broods myself&mdash;as likely and respectable
chickens as ever were a blessing to society&mdash;and
I think I ought to know a good hatcher and
brooder when I see her; and I know <em>that</em> fine
piece of trumpery, with her white feathers tipped
with gray, never will come down to family life.
<em>She</em> scratch for chickens! Bless me, she never
did anything in all her days but run round and
eat the worms which somebody else scratched up
for her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Master Bolton Gray heard this he
crowed very loudly, like a cock of spirit, and
declared that old Mrs. Scratchard was envious
because she had lost all her own tail-feathers,
and looked more like a worn-out old feather duster
than a respectable hen, and that therefore she
was filled with sheer envy of anybody that was
young and pretty. So young Mrs. Feathertop
cackled gay defiance at her busy rubbishy neighbor,
as she sunned herself under the bushes on
fine June afternoons.</p>

<p>Now Master Fred Little John had been allowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to have these hens by his mamma on the condition
that he would build their house himself,
and take all the care of it; and, to do Master
Fred justice, he executed the job in a small way
quite creditably. He chose a sunny sloping bank
covered with a thick growth of bushes, and
erected there a nice little hen-house, with two
glass windows, a little door, and a good pole for
his family to roost on. He made, moreover, a
row of nice little boxes with hay in them for
nests, and he bought three or four little smooth
white china eggs to put in them, so that, when
his hens <em>did</em> lay, he might carry off their eggs
without their being missed. The hen-house stood
in a little grove that sloped down to a wide
river, just where there was a little cove which
reached almost to the hen-house.</p>

<p>The situation inspired one of Master Fred&#8217;s
boy advisers with a new scheme in relation to his
poultry enterprise. &ldquo;Hullo! I say, Fred,&rdquo; said
Tom Seymour, &ldquo;you ought to raise ducks&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got a capital place for ducks there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&#8217;ve bought <em>hens</em>, you see,&rdquo; said
Freddy; &ldquo;so it&#8217;s no use trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use! Of course there is! Just as if
your hens couldn&#8217;t hatch ducks&#8217; eggs. Now, you
just wait till one of your hens wants to set, and
you put ducks&#8217; eggs under her, and you&#8217;ll have
a family of ducks in a twinkling. You can buy
ducks&#8217; eggs, a plenty, of old Sam under the hill;
he always has hens hatch his ducks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Freddy thought it would be a good experiment,
and informed his mother the next morning
that he intended to furnish the ducks for the
next Christmas dinner; and when she wondered
how he was to come by them, he said, mysteriously,
&ldquo;O, I will show you how!&rdquo; but did not
further explain himself. The next day he went
with Tom Seymour, and made a trade with old
Sam, and gave him a middle-aged jack-knife for
eight of his ducks&#8217; eggs. Sam, by the bye, was
a woolly-headed old negro man, who lived by the
pond hard by, and who had long cast envying
eyes on Fred&#8217;s jack-knife, because it was of
extra-fine steel, having been a Christmas present
the year before. But Fred knew very well there
were any number more of jack-knives where that
came from, and that, in order to get a new one,
he must dispose of the old; so he made the trade
and came home rejoicing.</p>

<p>Now, about this time Mrs. Feathertop, having
laid her eggs daily with great credit to herself,
notwithstanding Mrs. Scratchard&#8217;s predictions,
began to find herself suddenly attacked with nervous
symptoms. She lost her gay spirits, grew
dumpish and morose, stuck up her feathers in a
bristling way, and pecked at her neighbors if
they did so much as look at her. Master Gray
Cock was greatly concerned, and went to old
Doctor Peppercorn, who looked solemn and
recommended an infusion of angle-worms, and
said he would look in on the patient twice a
day till she was better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious me, Gray Cock!&rdquo; said old Goody
Kertarkut, who had been lolling at the corner as
he passed, &ldquo;a&#8217;n&#8217;t you a fool?&mdash;cocks always are
fools. Don&#8217;t you know what&#8217;s the matter with
your wife? She wants to set&mdash;that&#8217;s all; and
you just let her set! A fiddlestick for Doctor
Peppercorn! Why, any good old hen that has
brought up a family knows more than a doctor
about such things. You just go home and tell
her to set, if she wants to, and behave herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Gray Cock came home, he found that
Master Freddy had been before him, and established
Mrs. Feathertop upon eight nice eggs,
where she was sitting in gloomy grandeur. He
tried to make a little affable conversation with
her, and to relate his interview with the Doctor
and Goody Kertarkut, but she was morose and
sullen, and only pecked at him now and then in
a very sharp, unpleasant way; so, after a few
more efforts to make himself agreeable, he left
her, and went out promenading with the captivating
Mrs. Red Comb, a charming young
Spanish widow, who had just been imported into
the neighboring yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&#8217;ve no idea how
cross my wife is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O you horrid creature!&rdquo; said Mrs. Red Comb;
&ldquo;how little you feel for the weaknesses of us
poor hens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, ma&#8217;am,&rdquo; said Gray Cock, &ldquo;you
do me injustice. But when a hen gives way to
temper, ma&#8217;am and no longer meets her husband
with a smile&mdash;when she even pecks at him whom
she is bound to honor and obey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrid monster! talking of obedience! I
should say, sir, you came straight from Turkey!&rdquo;
And Mrs. Red Comb tossed her head with a most
bewitching air, and pretended to run away, and
old Mrs. Scratchard looked out of her coop and
called to Goody Kertarkut:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look how Mr. Gray Cock is flirting with that
widow. I always knew she was a baggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his poor wife left at home alone,&rdquo; said
Goody Kertarkut. &ldquo;It&#8217;s the way with &#8217;em all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard, &ldquo;she&#8217;ll know
what real life is now, and she won&#8217;t go about
holding her head so high, and looking down on
her practical neighbors that have raised families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor thing, what&#8217;ll she do with a family?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
said Goody Kertarkut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what business have such young flirts to
get married,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t
expect she&#8217;ll raise a single chick; and there&#8217;s
Gray Cock flirting about fine as ever. Folks
didn&#8217;t do so when I was young. I&#8217;m sure my husband
knew what treatment a setting hen ought to
have&mdash;poor old Long Spur&mdash;he never minded a
peck or so now and then. I must say these
modern fowls a&#8217;n&#8217;t what fowls used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun rose and set, and Master
Fred was almost the only friend and associate of
poor little Mrs. Feathertop, whom he fed daily
with meal and water, and only interrupted her
sad reflections by pulling her up occasionally to
see how the eggs were coming on.</p>

<p>At last &ldquo;Peep, peep, peep!&rdquo; began to be heard
in the nest, and one little downy head after another
poked forth from under the feathers, surveying
the world with round, bright, winking
eyes; and gradually the brood was hatched, and
Mrs. Feathertop arose, a proud and happy mother,
with all the bustling, scratching, caretaking instincts
of family life warm within her breast.
She clucked and scratched, and cuddled the little
downy bits of things as handily and discreetly
as a seven-year-old hen could have done, exciting
thereby the wonder of the community.</p>

<p>Master Gray Cock came home in high spirits
and complimented her; told her she was looking
charmingly once more, and said, &ldquo;Very well,
very nice!&rdquo; as he surveyed the young brood. So
that Mrs. Feathertop began to feel the world
going well with her, when suddenly in came
Dame Scratchard and Goody Kertarkut to make
a morning call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s see the chicks,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me,&rdquo; said Goody Kertarkut, &ldquo;what
a likeness to their dear papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but bless me, what&#8217;s the matter with
their bills?&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard. &ldquo;Why, my
dear, these chicks are deformed! I&#8217;m sorry for
you, my dear, but it&#8217;s all the result of your inexperience;
you ought to have eaten pebble-stones
with your meal when you were setting. Don&#8217;t
you see, Dame Kertarkut, what bills they have?
That&#8217;ll increase, and they&#8217;ll be frightful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; said Mrs. Feathertop, now
greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing as I know of,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard,
&ldquo;since you didn&#8217;t come to me before you set. I
could have told you all about it. Maybe it won&#8217;t
kill &#8217;em, but they&#8217;ll always be deformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the gossips departed, leaving a sting
under the pin-feathers of the poor little hen
mamma, who began to see that her darlings had
curious little spoon-bills different from her own,
and to worry and fret about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said to her spouse, &ldquo;do get Doctor
Peppercorn to come in and look at their bills,
and see if anything can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Peppercorn came in, and put on a
monstrous pair of spectacles and said: &ldquo;Hum!
Ha! Extraordinary case&mdash;very singular!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like it, Doctor?&rdquo;
said both parents, in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve read of such cases. It&#8217;s a calcareous enlargement
of the vascular bony tissue, threatening
ossification,&ldquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dreadful!&mdash;can it be possible?&rdquo; shrieked
both parents. &ldquo;Can anything be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should recommend a daily lotion made
of mosquitoes&#8217; horns and bicarbonate of frogs&#8217;
toes together with a powder, to be taken morning
and night, of muriate of fleas. One thing you
must be careful about: they must never wet their
feet, nor drink any water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Doctor, I don&#8217;t know what I <em>shall</em>
do, for they seem to have a particular fancy for
getting into water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a morbid tendency often found in these
cases of bony tumification of the vascular tissue
of the mouth; but you must resist it, ma&#8217;am, as
their life depends upon it.&rdquo; And with that Doctor
Peppercorn glared gloomily on the young
ducks, who were stealthily poking the objectionable
little spoon-bills out from under their
mothers&#8217; feathers.</p>

<p>After this poor Mrs. Feathertop led a weary
life of it; for the young fry were as healthy
and enterprising a brood of young ducks as
ever carried saucepans on the end of their noses,
and they most utterly set themselves against the
doctor&#8217;s prescriptions, murmured at the muriate
of fleas and the bicarbonate of frogs&#8217; toes and
took every opportunity to waddle their little ways
down to the mud and water which was in their
near vicinity. So their bills grew larger and
larger, as did the rest of their bodies, and family
government grew weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll wear me out children, you certainly
will,&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Feathertop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll go to destruction, do ye hear?&rdquo; said
Master Gray Cock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such frights as poor Mrs.
Feathertop has got?&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard. &ldquo;I
knew what would come of <em>her</em> family&mdash;all deformed,
and with a dreadful sort of madness,
which makes them love to shovel mud with those
shocking spoon-bills of theirs.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/img77.jpg" width="372" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;they must never wet their feet, nor drink any water,&rdquo; said the doctor</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a kind of idiocy,&rdquo; said Goody Kertarkut.
&ldquo;Poor things! they can&#8217;t be kept from the water,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
nor made to take powders, and so they got worse
and worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand it&#8217;s affecting their feet so that
they can&#8217;t walk, and a dreadful sort of net is
growing between their toes; what a shocking
visitation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She brought it on herself,&rdquo; said Dame Scratchard.
&ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t she come to me before she
set? She was always an upstart, self-conceited
thing, but I&#8217;m sure I pity her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young ducks throve apace.
Their necks grew glossy like changeable green
and gold satin, and though they would not take
the doctor&#8217;s medicine, and would waddle in the
mud and water&mdash;for which they always felt themselves
to be very naughty ducks&mdash;yet they grew
quite vigorous and hearty. At last one day the
whole little tribe waddled off down to the bank
of the river. It was a beautiful day, and the
river was dancing and dimpling and winking as
the little breezes shook the trees that hung over
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the biggest of the little ducks,
&ldquo;in spite of Doctor Peppercorn I can&#8217;t help longing
for the water. I don&#8217;t believe it is going to
hurt me; at any rate, here goes.&rdquo; And in he
plumped, and in went every duck after him, and
they threw out their great brown feet as cleverly
as if they had taken rowing-lessons all their lives,
and sailed off on the river, away, away, among
the ferns, under the pink azalias, through reeds
and rushes and arrow-heads and pickerel-weed,
the happiest ducks that ever were born; and soon
they were quite out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Feathertop, this is a dispensation,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Scratchard. &ldquo;Your children are all
drowned at last, just as I knew they&#8217;d be. The
old music-teacher Master Bullfrog, that lives
down in Water-Dock Lane, saw &#8217;em all plump
madly into the water together this morning;
that&#8217;s what comes of not knowing how to bring
up a family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Feathertop gave only one shriek and
fainted dead away, and was carried home on a
cabbage leaf, and Mr. Gray Cock was sent for,
where he was waiting on Mrs. Red Comb through
the squash vines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a serious time in your family, sir,&rdquo; said
Goody Kertarkut, &ldquo;and you ought to be at home
supporting your wife. Send for Doctor Peppercorn
without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now as the case was a very dreadful one,
Doctor Peppercorn called a council from the
barnyard of the Squire two miles off, and a brisk
young Doctor Partlett appeared in a fine suit
of brown and gold, with tail-feathers like meteors.
A fine young fellow he was, lately from Paris,
with all the modern scientific improvements fresh
in his head.</p>

<p>When he had listened to the whole story, he
clapped his spur into the ground, and, leaning
back laughed so loud that all the cocks in the
neighborhood crowed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Feathertop rose up out of her swoon, and
Mr. Gray Cock was greatly enraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir, by such behavior in
the house of mourning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, pardon me, but there is no
occasion for mourning. My dear madam, let
me congratulate you. There is no harm done.
The simple matter is, dear madam, you have
been under a hallucination all along. The neighborhood
and my learned friend the doctor have
all made a mistake in thinking that these children
of yours were hens at all. They are ducks,
ma&#8217;am, evidently ducks, and very finely formed
ducks, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a quack was heard, and at a
distance the whole tribe were seen coming waddling
home, their feathers gleaming in green and
gold, and they themselves in high good spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a splendid day as we have had!&rdquo; they
all cried in a breath. &ldquo;And we know now how
to get our own living; we can take care of ourselves
in future, so you need have no further
trouble with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Doctor, making a bow with
an air which displayed his tail-feathers to advantage,
&ldquo;let me congratulate you on the charming
family you have raised. A finer brood of
young healthy ducks I never saw. Give claw,
my dear friend,&rdquo; he said, addressing the elder
son. &ldquo;In our barnyard no family is more respected
than that of the ducks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so Madam Feathertop came off glorious
at last; and when after this the ducks used to go
swimming up and down the river, like so many
nabobs, among the admiring hens, Doctor Peppercorn
used to look after them and say: &ldquo;Ah! I
had the care of their infancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Gray Cock and his wife used to say
to each other: &ldquo;It was our system of education
did that!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY ANNA HEMPSTEAD BRANCH</strong></p>


<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 There was a lad named Piping Will<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With tattered coat and poor;</span><br />
 He had no home to bide him in,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But roamed from door to door.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 This lad had naught except a pipe<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">On which he used to play;</span><br />
 Yet never lad did laugh so free,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor had a look so gay.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Nay, bide, thou merry piper-boy!&rdquo;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kindly house-dames said.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;The roads are rough, the skies are wild,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thou dost lack for bread.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;The hills are steep, the stones unkind&mdash;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why wilt thou always roam?</span><br />
 And winter turns a barren heart<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To them that have no home.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 Then would he smile and pipe awhile,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But would not ever stay.</span><br />
 How strange that he could be so poor,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet have a heart so gay!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 And so the good folk shook their heads,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they would turn and stare</span><br />
 To see him piping through the fields.<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What was he doing there?</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 It fell about the blithe Yule-tide,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When winter winds were keen,</span><br />
 The Burgomaster&#8217;s little maid<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slipped from the house unseen;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 For she had heard that in the wood<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dear snow-children run,</span><br />
 And play where shadows are most cold<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And where there is no sun.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 But lo, the evening hurried on,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bitter sleet blew cold;</span><br />
 It whitened all her scarlet cloak<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flying locks of gold.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 The road was hid, and she was lost,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knew not where to go;</span><br />
 And still the sharp blast swept her on,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whether she would or no.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 Now who is this amid the sleet?<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">His face she cannot see!</span><br />
 He tunes his pipe against the wind,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As merry as can be.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 He tunes his pipe against the wind<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With music sweet and wild,</span><br />
 When lo, a fluttering scarlet cape,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sobbing of a child!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 He took her up and held her close;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">&ldquo;I&#8217;ll take you home,&rdquo; he said.</span><br />
 But still the little maid sobbed on,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor was she comforted.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;What! Cold and hungry, little maid,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And frightened of the storm?</span><br />
 I&#8217;ll play upon my pipe,&rdquo; said he,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">&ldquo;And that will keep you warm!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 And lo, when first he blew his pipe,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was a wondrous thing&mdash;</span><br />
 The sleet and snow turned all to flowers,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds began to sing!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 When next he blew upon his pipe,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">She marveled more and more;</span><br />
 For, built of gold with strange device,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A palace rose before!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 A lovely lady led them in,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there they sat them down;</span><br />
 The piper wore a purple cloak,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she a snow-white gown.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 And there was song and light and cheer,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feasting and everything!</span><br />
 Who would have thought that Piping Will<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could be so great a king?</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 The third time that he blew his pipe<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They took her to the queen;</span><br />
 Her hair was yellow as the sun,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she was clothed in green.</span></p>

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 Yet did she kiss that little maid,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who should no longer roam&mdash;</span><br />
 When lo, the dear dream flashed away,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there she was at home!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Make this thy home, thou Piping Will,&rdquo;</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Burgomaster cried.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Thou hast restored our little maid!</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I tell thee, thou must bide.&rdquo;</span></p>

   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bustling mother said.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Come, warm thyself before the hearth</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eat the good white bread.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 But Piping Will would only smile:<br />
  <span style="margin-left: .5em;">&ldquo;Good friends, I cannot wait!&rdquo;</span><br />
 (Who could have thought that tattered coat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been a robe of state!)</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 So forth he fared into the night,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, piping, went his way.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;a lad so poor</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can have a heart so gay!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 Only the little maid that sat<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon her father&#8217;s knee</span><br />
 Remembered how they two had fared<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That night right pleasantly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 And as she ate her bread and milk,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So close and safe and warm,</span><br />
 She wondered what strange, lovely lands<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He wrought of wind and storm.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
 For he that plays a fairy pipe<br />

<h2>LITTLE ANNIE&#8217;S DREAM, OR THE FAIRY FLOWER</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY LOUISA M. ALCOTT</strong></p>


<p>In a large and pleasant garden sat little Annie,
all alone, and she seemed very sad, for drops
that were not dew fell fast upon the flowers beside
her, which looked wonderingly up, and bent
still nearer, as if they longed to cheer and comfort
her. The warm wind lifted up her shining
hair, and softly kissed her cheek, while the sunbeams,
looking most kindly in her face, made
little rainbows in her tears, and lingered lovingly
about her. But Annie paid no heed to sun, or
wind, or flower; still the bright tears fell, and
she forgot all but her sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Annie, tell me why you weep,&rdquo; said a
low voice in her ear; and, looking up, the child
beheld a little figure standing on a vine leaf at
her side; a lovely face smiled on her from amid
bright locks of hair, and shining wings were
folded on a white and glittering robe that fluttered
in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, lovely little thing?&rdquo; cried
Annie, smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Fairy, little child, and am come to
help and comfort you; now tell me why you
weep, and let me be your friend,&rdquo; replied the
spirit, as she smiled more kindly still on Annie&#8217;s
wondering face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you really, then, a little Elf, such
as I read of in my fairy books? Do you ride
on butterflies, sleep in flower-cups, and live
among the clouds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all these things I do, and many stranger
still that all your fairy books can never tell;
but now, dear Annie,&rdquo; said the Fairy, bending
nearer, &ldquo;tell me why I found no sunshine on
your face; why are these great drops shining on
the flower and why do you sit alone when bird
and bee are calling you to play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you will not love me any more if I should
tell you all,&rdquo; said Annie, while the tears began
to fall again; &ldquo;I am not happy, for I am not
good; how shall I learn to be a patient, gentle
child? Good little Fairy, will you teach me how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly will I aid you Annie. The task is hard,
but I will give this fairy flower to help and
counsel you. Bend hither, that I may place it on
your breast; no hand can take it hence, till I
unsay the spell that holds it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As thus she spoke, the Elf took from her bosom
a graceful flower, whose snow-white leaves shone
with a strange, soft light. &ldquo;This is a fairy
flower,&rdquo; said the Elf, &ldquo;invisible to every eye
save yours; now listen while I tell its power,
Annie. When your heart is filled with loving
thoughts, when some kindly deed has been done,
some duty well performed, then from the flower
there will arise the sweetest, softest fragrance, to
reward and gladden you. But when an unkind
word is on your lips, when a selfish, angry feeling
rises in your heart, or an unkind, cruel deed
is to be done, then will you hear the soft, low
chime of the flower bell; listen to its warning, let
the word remain unspoken, the deed undone, and
in the quiet joy of your own heart, and the magic
perfume of your bosom flower, you will find a
sweet reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O kind and generous Fairy, how can I ever
thank you for this lovely gift!&rdquo; cried Annie.
&ldquo;I will be true, and listen to my little bell whenever
it may ring. But shall I never see you
more? Ah! if you would only stay with me, I
should indeed be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot stay now, little Annie,&rdquo; said the
Elf, &ldquo;but when another Spring comes round, I
shall be here again, to see how well the fairy gift
has done its work. And now farewell, dear child;
be faithful to yourself, and the magic flower will
never fade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the gentle Fairy folded her little arms
around Annie&#8217;s neck, laid a soft kiss on her
cheek, and, spreading wide her shining wings,
flew singing up among the white clouds floating
in the sky.</p>

<p>And little Annie sat among her flowers, and
watched with wondering joy the fairy blossom
shining on her breast.</p>

<p>The pleasant days of Spring and Summer passed
away, and in little Annie&#8217;s garden Autumn flowers
were blooming everywhere, with each day&#8217;s sun
and dew growing still more beautiful and bright;
but the fairy flower, that should have been the
loveliest of all, hung pale and drooping on little
Annie&#8217;s bosom; its fragrance seemed quite gone,
and the clear, low music of its warning chime
rang often in her ear.</p>

<p>When first the Fairy placed it there, she had
been pleased with her new gift, and for a while
obeyed the fairy bell, and often tried to win some
fragrance from the flower by kind and pleasant
words and actions; then, as the Fairy said, she
found a sweet reward in the strange, soft perfume
of the magic blossom as it shone upon her breast;
but selfish thoughts would come to tempt her,
she would yield, and unkind words fell from her
lips; and then the flower drooped pale and scentless,
the fairy bell rang mournfully, Annie would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
forget her better resolutions, and be again a selfish,
willful little child.</p>

<p>At last she tried no longer, but grew angry
with the faithful flower, and would have torn it
from her breast; but the fairy spell still held it
fast, and all her angry words but made it ring a
louder, sadder peal. Then she paid no heed to
the silvery music sounding in her ear, and each
day grew still more unhappy, discontented, and
unkind; so, when the Autumn days came round,
she was no better for the gentle Fairy&#8217;s gift, and
longed for Spring, that it might be returned; for
now the constant echo of the mournful music
made her very sad.</p>

<p>One sunny morning, when the fresh, cool
winds were blowing, and not a cloud was in the
sky, little Annie walked among her flowers, looking
carefully into each, hoping thus to find the
Fairy, who alone could take the magic blossom
from her breast. But she lifted up their drooping
leaves, peeped into their dewy cups in vain;
no little Elf lay hidden there, and she turned
sadly from them all, saying: &ldquo;I will go out into
the fields and woods, and seek her there. I will
not listen to this tiresome music more, nor wear
this withered flower longer.&rdquo; So out into the
fields she went, where the long grass rustled as
she passed, and timid birds looked at her from
their nests; where lovely wild flowers nodded in
the wind, and opened wide their fragrant leaves
to welcome in the murmuring bees, while butterflies,
like winged flowers, danced and glittered in
the sun.</p>

<p>Little Annie looked, searched, and asked them
all if any one could tell her of the Fairy whom
she sought; but the birds looked wonderingly at
her with their soft, bright eyes, and still sang on;
the flowers nodded wisely on their stems, but did
not speak, while butterfly and bee buzzed and
fluttered away, one far too busy, the other too
idle, to stay and tell her what she asked.</p>

<p>Then she went through broad fields of yellow
grain that waved around her like a golden forest;
here crickets chirped, grasshoppers leaped, and
busy ants worked, but they could not tell her
what she longed to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now will I go among the hills,&rdquo; said Annie,
&ldquo;she may be there.&rdquo; So up and down the green
hillsides went her little feet; long she searched
and vainly she called; but still no Fairy came.
Then by the riverside she went, and asked the
gay dragon flies and the cool white lilies if the
Fairy had been there; but the blue waves rippled
on the white sand at her feet, and no voice
answered her.</p>

<p>Then into the forest little Annie went; and as
she passed along the dim, cool paths, the wood-flowers
smiled up in her face, gay squirrels
peeped at her, as they swung amid the vines, and
doves cooed softly as she wandered by; but none
could answer her. So, weary with her long
and useless search, she sat amid the ferns, and
feasted on the rosy strawberries that grew beside
her, watching meanwhile the crimson evening
clouds that glowed around the setting sun.</p>

<p>The night-wind rustled through the boughs,
and when the autumn moon rose up, her silver
light shone on the child, where, pillowed on green
moss, she lay asleep amid the wood-flowers in the
dim old forest.</p>

<p>And all night long beside her stood the Fairy
she had sought, and by elfin spell and charm sent
to the sleeping child this dream.</p>

<p>Little Annie dreamed she sat in her own garden,
as she had often sat before, with angry feelings
in her heart, and unkind words upon her
lips. The magic flower was ringing its soft
warning, but she paid no heed to anything, save
her own troubled thoughts; thus she sat, when
suddenly a low voice whispered in her ear:
&ldquo;Little Annie, look and see the evil things that
you are cherishing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Annie saw, with fear and wonder, that
the angry words she uttered changed to dark,
unlovely forms, each showing plainly from what
fault or passion it had sprung. Some of the
shapes had scowling faces and bright, fiery eyes;
these were the spirits of Anger. Others, with
sullen, anxious, looks seemed gathering up all
they could reach, and Annie saw that the more
they gained, the less they seemed to have; and
these she knew were shapes of Selfishness.
Spirits of Pride were there, who folded their
shadowy garments round them, and turned scornfully
away from all the rest. These and many
others little Annie saw, which had come from
her own heart, and taken form before her eyes.</p>

<p>When first she saw them, they were small and
weak; but as she looked they seemed to grow and
gather strength, and each gained a strange power
over her. She could not drive them from her
sight, and they grew ever stronger, darker, and
more unlovely to her eyes. They seemed to cast
black shadows over all around, to dim the sunshine,
blight the flowers, and drive away all
bright and lovely things; while rising slowly
round her Annie saw a high, dark wall, that
seemed to shut out everything she loved; she
dared not move, or speak, but, with a strange fear
at her heart, sat watching the dim shapes that
hovered round her.</p>

<p>Higher and higher rose the shadowy wall.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Slowly the flowers near her died, lingeringly the
sunlight faded; but at last they both were gone,
and left her all alone behind the gloomy wall.
Then she could hear no more, but, sinking down
among the withered flowers, wept sad and bitter
tears, for her lost liberty and joy; then through
the gloom there shone a faint, soft light, and on
her breast she saw her fairy flower, upon whose
snow-white leaves her tears lay shining.</p>

<p>Clearer and brighter grew the radiant light, till
the evil spirits turned away to the dark shadow
of the wall, and left the child alone.</p>

<p>The light and perfume of the flower seemed to
bring new strength to Annie, and she rose up,
saying, as she bent to kiss the blossom on her
breast: &ldquo;Dear flower, help and guide me now,
and I will listen to your voice, and cheerfully
obey my faithful fairy bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then in her dreams she felt how hard the
spirits tried to tempt and trouble her, and how,
but for her flower, they would have led her back,
and made all dark and dreary as before. Long
and hard she struggled, and tears often fell; but
after each new trial, brighter shone her magic
flower, and sweeter grew its breath, while the
spirits lost still more their power to tempt her.
Meanwhile, green, flowering vines crept up the
high, dark wall, and hid its roughness from her
sight; and over these she watched most tenderly,
for soon, wherever green leaves and flowers
bloomed, the wall beneath grew weak, and fell
apart. Thus little Annie worked and hoped, till
one by one the evil spirits fled away, and in their
place came shining forms, with gentle eyes and
smiling lips, who gathered round her with such
loving words, and brought such strength and joy
to Annie&#8217;s heart, that nothing evil dared to enter
in; while slowly sank the gloomy wall, and, over
wreaths of fragrant flowers, she passed out into
the pleasant world again, the fairy gift no longer
pale and drooping, but now shining like a star
upon her breast.</p>

<p>Then the low voice spoke again in Annie&#8217;s
sleeping ear, saying: &ldquo;Remember well the lesson
of the dream, dear child, and let the shining
spirits make your heart their home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that voice sounding in her ear, little
Annie woke to find it was a dream; but like other
dreams it did not pass away; and as she sat
alone, bathed in the rosy morning light, and
watched the forest waken into life, she silently
resolved to strive, as she had striven in her
dream, to bring back light and beauty to its faded
leaves, by being what the Fairy hoped to render
her, a patient, gentle little child. And as the
thought came to her mind, the flower raised its
drooping head, and, looking up into the earnest
little face bent over it, seemed by its fragrant
breath to answer Annie&#8217;s silent thought, and
strengthen her for what might come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the forest was astir, birds sang
their gay good-morrows from tree to tree, while
leaf and flower turned to greet the sun, who rose
up smiling on the world; and so beneath the
forest boughs and through the dewy fields went
little Annie home, better and wiser for her
dream.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Autumn flowers were dead and gone, white
winter snow fell softly down; yet now, when all
without looked dark and dreary, on little Annie&#8217;s
breast the fairy flower bloomed more beautiful
than ever. The memory of her forest dream had
never passed away, and through trial and temptation
she had been true, and kept her resolution
still unbroken; seldom now did the warning bell
sound in her ear, and seldom did the flower&#8217;s
fragrance cease to float about her, or the fairy
light to brighten all whereon it fell.</p>

<p>So, through the long, cold winter, little Annie
dwelt like a sunbeam in her home, each day
growing richer in the love of others, and happier
in herself; often was she tempted, but, remembering
her dream, she listened only to the music
of the fairy bell, and the unkind thought or feeling
fled away, the smiling spirits of gentleness
and love nestled in her heart, and all was bright
again.</p>

<p>At length, one day, as she sat singing in the
sunny nook where all her fairest flowers bloomed,
weary with gazing at the far-off sky for the little
forms she hoped would come, she bent to look
with joyful love upon her bosom flower; and as
she looked, its folded leaves spread wide apart,
and, rising slowly from the deep white cup,
appeared the smiling face of the lovely Elf whose
coming she had waited for so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Annie, look for me no longer; I am
here on your breast, for you have learned
to love my gift, and it has done its work most
faithfully and well,&rdquo; the Fairy said, as she looked
into the happy child&#8217;s bright face, and laid her
little arms most tenderly about her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now have I brought another gift from
Fairy-land, as a fit reward for you, dear child,&rdquo;
she said, when Annie had told all her gratitude
and love; then, touching the child with her shining
wand, the Fairy bid her look and listen
silently.</p>

<p>And suddenly the world, to Annie, seemed
changed for the air was filled with strange, sweet
sounds, and all around her floated lovely forms.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
In every flower sat little smiling Elves, singing
gayly as they rocked amid the leaves. On every
breeze, bright, airy spirits came floating by;
some fanned her cheek with their cool breath,
and waved her long hair to and fro, while others
rang the flower-bells, and made a pleasant rustling
among the leaves. In the fountain, where
the water danced and sparkled in the sun, astride
of every drop she saw merry little spirits, who
plashed and floated in the clear, cool waves, and
sang as gayly as the flowers, on whom they
scattered glittering dew. The tall trees, as their
branches rustled in the wind, sang a low, dreamy
song, while the waving grass was filled with little
voices she had never heard before. Butterflies
whispered lovely tales in her ear, and birds sang
cheerful songs in a sweet language she had never
understood before. Earth and air seemed filled
with beauty and with music she had never
dreamed of until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me what it means, dear Fairy! is it
another and a lovelier dream, or is the earth in
truth so beautiful as this?&rdquo; she cried, looking
with wondering joy upon the Elf, who lay upon
the flower on her breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true, dear child,&rdquo; replied the Fairy,
&ldquo;and few are the mortals to whom we give this
lovely gift; what to you is now so full of music
and of light, to others is but a pleasant summer
world; they never know the language of butterfly
or bird or flower, and they are blind to all that
I have given you the power to see. These fair
things are your friends and playmates now, and
they will teach you many pleasant lessons, and
give you many happy hours; while the garden
where you once sat, weeping sad and bitter tears,
is now brightened by your own happiness, filled
with loving friends by your own kindly thoughts
and feelings; and thus rendered a pleasant summer
home for the gentle, happy child, whose
bosom flower will never fade. And now, dear
Annie, I must go; but every springtime, with
the earliest flowers, will I come again to visit you,
and bring some fairy gift. Guard well the magic
flower, that I may find all fair and bright when
next I come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, with a kind farewell, the gentle Fairy
floated upward through the sunny air, smiling
down upon the child, until she vanished in the
soft, white clouds; and little Annie stood alone
in her enchanted garden, where all was brightened
with the radiant light, and fragrant with the perfume
of her fairy flower.</p>

<h2><a name="COMPANIONS" id="COMPANIONS"></a>COMPANIONS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HELEN HUNT JACKSON</strong></p>


<p>During the whole of one of a summer&#8217;s hottest
days I had the good fortune to be seated in a
railway car near a mother and four children,
whose relations with each other were so beautiful
that the pleasure of watching them was quite
enough to make one forget the discomforts of the
journey.</p>

<p>It was plain that they were poor; their clothes
were coarse and old, and had been made by inexperienced
hands. The mother&#8217;s bonnet alone
would have been enough to have condemned the
whole party on any of the world&#8217;s thoroughfares.
I remembered afterward, with shame, that I myself
had smiled at the first sight of its antiquated
ugliness; but her face was one which it gave you
a sense of rest to look upon&mdash;it was so earnest,
tender, true, and strong. It had little comeliness
of shape or color in it, it was thin, and pale; she
was not young; she had worked hard; she had
evidently been much ill; but I have seen few faces
which gave me such pleasure. I think that she
was the wife of a poor clergyman; and I think
that clergyman must be one of the Lord&#8217;s best
watchmen of souls. The children&mdash;two boys and
two girls&mdash;were all under the age of 12, and the
youngest could not speak plainly. They had had
a rare treat; they had been visiting the mountains,
and they were talking over all the wonders they
had seen with a glow of enthusiastic delight which
was to be envied. Only a word-for-word record
would do justice to their conversation; no description
could give any idea of it&mdash;so free, so pleasant,
so genial, no interruptions, no contradictions; and
the mother&#8217;s part borne all the while with such
equal interest and eagerness that no one not seeing
her face would dream that she was any other than
an elder sister.</p>

<p>In the course of the day there were many occasions
when it was necessary for her to deny
requests, and to ask services, especially from the
eldest boy; but no young girl, anxious to please a
lover, could have done either with a more tender
courtesy. She had her reward; for no lover
could have been more tender and manly than was
this boy of 12. Their lunch was simple and
scanty; but it had the grace of a royal banquet.
At the last, the mother produced with much glee
three apples and an orange, of which the children
had not known. All eyes fastened on the
orange. It was evidently a great rarity. I
watched to see if this test would bring out selfishness.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
There was a little silence; just the shade of
a cloud. The mother said: &ldquo;How shall I divide
this? There is one for each of you; and I shall
be best off of all, for I expect big tastes from
each of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, give Annie the orange. Annie loves
oranges,&rdquo; spoke out the oldest boy, with a sudden
air of a conqueror, and at the same time taking
the smallest and worst apple himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, let Annie have the orange,&rdquo; echoed
the second boy, nine years old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Annie may have the orange, because that
is nicer than the apple, and she is a lady, and her
brothers are gentlemen,&rdquo; said the mother, quietly.
Then there was a merry contest as to who should
feed the mother with largest and most frequent
mouthfuls; and so the feast went on. Then Annie
pretended to want an apple, and exchanged thin
golden strips of orange for bites out of the cheeks
of Baldwins; and, as I sat watching her intently,
she suddenly fancied she saw longing in my face,
and sprang over to me, holding out a quarter of
her orange, and saying, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you want a taste,
too?&rdquo; The mother smiled, understandingly, when
I said, &ldquo;No, I thank you, you dear, generous little
girl; I don&#8217;t care about oranges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At noon we had a tedious interval of waiting at
a dreary station. We sat for two hours on a narrow
platform, which the sun had scorched till it
smelled of heat. The oldest boy&mdash;the little lover&mdash;held
the youngest child, and talked to her, while
the tired mother closed her eyes and rested. Now
and then he looked over at her, and then back at
the baby; and at last he said confidentially to me
(for we had become fast friends by this time):
&ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it funny, to think that I was ever so small
as this baby? And papa says that then mamma
was almost a little girl herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two other children were toiling up and
down the banks of the railroad track, picking ox-eye
daisies, buttercups, and sorrel. They worked
like beavers, and soon the bunches were almost too
big for their little hands. Then they came running
to give them to their mother. &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;how that poor, tired woman will hate to
open her eyes! and she never can take those great
bunches of common, fading flowers, in addition
to all her bundles and bags.&rdquo; I was mistaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, my darlings! How kind you
were! Poor, hot, tired little flowers, how thirsty
they look! If they will only try and keep alive
till we get home, we will make them very happy
in some water; won&#8217;t we? And you shall put one
bunch by papa&#8217;s plate, and one by mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sweet and happy, the weary and flushed little
children stood looking up in her face while she
talked, their hearts thrilling with compassion for
the drooping flowers and with delight in the giving
of their gift. Then she took great trouble to
get a string and tie up the flowers, and then the
train came, and we were whirling along again.
Soon it grew dark, and little Annie&#8217;s head nodded.
Then I heard the mother say to the oldest boy,
&ldquo;Dear, are you too tired to let little Annie put her
head on your shoulder and take a nap? We shall
get her home in much better ease to see papa if
we can manage to give her a little sleep.&rdquo; How
many boys of twelve hear such words as these
from tired, overburdened mothers?</p>

<p>Soon came the city, the final station, with its
bustle and noise. I lingered to watch my happy
family, hoping to see the father. &ldquo;Why, papa
isn&#8217;t here!&rdquo; exclaimed one disappointed little voice
after another. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the mother,
with a still deeper disappointment in her own tone;
&ldquo;perhaps he had to go to see some poor body who
is sick.&rdquo; In the hurry of picking up all the
parcels, and the sleepy babies, the poor daisies
and buttercups were left forgotten in a corner of
the rack. I wondered if the mother had not intended
this. May I be forgiven for the injustice!
A few minutes after I passed the little group,
standing still just outside the station, and heard
the mother say, &ldquo;Oh, my darlings, I have forgotten
your pretty bouquets. I am so sorry! I
wonder if I could find them if I went back. Will
you all stand still if I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, don&#8217;t go, don&#8217;t go. We will get
you some more. Don&#8217;t go,&rdquo; cried all the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are your flowers, madam,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
saw that you had forgotten them, and I took them
as mementos of you and your sweet children.&rdquo;
She blushed and looked disconcerted. She was
evidently unused to people, and shy with all but
her children. However, she thanked me sweetly,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry about them. The children
took such trouble to get them, and I think they
will revive in water. They cannot be quite dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will never die!&rdquo; said I, with an emphasis
which went from my heart to hers. Then all her
shyness fled. She knew me; and we shook hands,
and smiled into each other&#8217;s eyes with the smile of
kindred as we parted.</p>

<p>As I followed on, I heard the two children, who
were walking behind, saying to each other:
&ldquo;Wouldn&#8217;t that have been too bad? Mamma liked
them so much, and we never could have got so
many all at once again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we could, too, next Summer,&rdquo; said the boy,
sturdily.</p>

<p>They are sure of their &ldquo;next summers,&rdquo; I think,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
all six of those souls&mdash;children, and mother, and
father. They may never again gather so many
ox-eye daisies and buttercups &ldquo;all at once.&rdquo; Perhaps
some of the little hands have already picked
their last flowers. Nevertheless, their summers
are certain. To such souls as these, all trees,
either here or in God&#8217;s larger country, are Trees of
Life, with twelve manner of fruits and leaves for
healing; and it is but little change from the summers
here, whose suns burn and make weary, to the
summers there, of which &ldquo;the Lamb is the light.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="LITTLE" id="LITTLE"></a>PRINCE LITTLE BOY</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY S. WEIR MITCHELL</strong></p>


<p>A great many children live on the borders of
Fairy-land and never visit it at all, and really
there are people who grow up and are not very
unhappy who will not believe they have lived
near to it all their lives. But if once you have
been in that pleasant country you never quite
forget it, and when some stupid man says, &ldquo;It is
all stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; you do not say much, even
if you yourself have come to be an old fellow
with hair of two colors, but you feel proud to
know how much more you have seen of the world
than he has. Children are the best travelers in
Fairy-land, and there also is another kingdom
which is easy for them to reach and hard for
some older folks.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a small boy who
lived so near to Fairy-land that he sometimes got
over the fence and inside of that lovely country,
but, being a little afraid, never went very far,
and was quick to run home if he saw Blue Beard
or an Ogre or even Goody Two-Shoes. Once or
twice he went a little farther, and saw things
which may be seen but can never be written.</p>

<p>Sometimes he told his father that he had been
into Fairy-land; but his father, who was a brick-maker
and lived in the wood, only laughed, and
cried aloud; &ldquo;Next time you go, be sure to fetch
back some fairy money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day the small boy, whose real name was
Little Boy, told his father that he had gone a
mile into Fairy-land, and that there the people
were born old and grew younger all the time, and
that on this account the hands of their clocks went
backward. When his father heard this, he said
that boy was only fit to sing songs and be in the
sun, and would never make bricks worth a penny.
Then he added, sharply, that his son must get to
work at once and stop going over the fence to
Fairy-land. So, after that, Little Boy was set
to dig clay and make bricks for a palace which
the King was building. He made a great many
bricks of all colors, and did seem to work so very
hard that his father began to think he might in
time come to make the best of bricks. But if you
are making bricks you must not even be thinking
of fairies, because something is sure to get into
the bricks and spoil them for building anything
except a Spanish castle or a palace of Aladdin.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that while Little Boy made
bricks and patted them well and helped to bake
them hard he was forever thinking of a Fairy
who had kissed him one day in the wood. This
was a very strange Fairy, large, with white
limbs, and eyes which were full of joy for a
child, but to such as being old looked upon them,
were, as the poet says, &ldquo;lakes of sadness.&rdquo; Perhaps,
being little, you who read can understand
this. I cannot; but whoever has once seen this
Fairy loves the sun and the woods and all living
creatures, and knows things without being taught,
and what men will say before they say it. Yet,
while he knows all these strange things, and what
birds talk about, and what songs the winds sing
to the trees, he can never make good bricks.</p>

<p>And this was why Little Boy&#8217;s bricks were
badly made; on account of which the King&#8217;s
palace, having many poor bricks in it, fell down
one fine day and cracked the crowns of twenty-three
courtiers and had like to have killed the
King himself. This made the King very angry,
so he put on his crown and said wicked words,
and told everybody he would give one hundred
pieces of gold to whoever would find the person
who had made the bad bricks. When Little Boy&#8217;s
father heard this, he knew it must have been his
son who was to blame. So he told his son that
he had been very careless, and that surely the
King would kill him, and that the best thing he
could do would be to run away and hide in Fairy-land.</p>

<p>Little Boy was very badly scared, and was well
pleased when his mother had put some cakes and
apples in a bag and slung it over his shoulder and
told him to run quickly away; and this he was
glad to do, because he saw the King&#8217;s soldiers
coming over the hill to take him. When they
came to his father&#8217;s house his father told them
that it was his son who had made the bad bricks.
After hearing this, they let the man go, and went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
after Little Boy. As their legs were long and his
were short, they soon got very near to him, and
he had just time to scramble over the fence into
Fairy-land. Then the soldiers began to get over
the fence, too; but at this moment the giant Fee-Faw-Fum
came out of the wood, and said, in a
voice that was as loud as the roar of the winds
of a winter night: &ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;
This gave them such a fright that they all sat
there in a row on top of the fence like sparrows,
and could not move for a week. You may be
sure Little Boy did not stop to look at them, but
ran away, far away into Fairy-land. Of course,
he soon got lost, because in the geographies there
is not a word about Fairy-land, and nobody
knows even what bounds it on the north.</p>

<p>It is sad to be lost, but not in Fairy-land. The
sooner you lose yourself, the happier you are. And
then such queer things chance to you&mdash;things no
one could dream would happen. Mostly it is the
children for whom they occur, and the grown-up
person who is quite happy in this joyous land
is not often to be met with. Perhaps you think I
will tell you all about the fairy country. Not I,
indeed. I have been there in my time; but my
travels there I cannot write, or else I might never
be allowed to return again.</p>

<p>By-and-by Little Boy grew tired and went into
a deep wood and there sat down and ate a cake,
and saw very soon that the squirrels were throwing
him nuts from the trees. Of course, as he
was in Fairy-land, this was just what one might
have expected. He tried to crack the nuts with
his teeth, but could not, and this troubled the
squirrels so much that presently nine of them came
down and sat around him and began to crack nuts
for him and to laugh.</p>

<p>When Little Boy had finished his meal, he lay
down and tried to go to sleep, for it was pleasant
and warm, and the moss was soft to lie upon, and
strange birds came and went and sang love-songs.
But just as he was almost asleep he was shaken
quite roughly, and when he looked up saw a
beautiful Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I heard you getting
ready to snore. A moment more and I should
have been too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said Little Boy, &ldquo;and who are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am Fine Ear, and before things happen
I hear them. Do not you know, Fair Sir&rdquo; (this
is the way fairies speak), &ldquo;that if you fall asleep
the first day that you are in Fairy-land, it is
years before you wake? Some people don&#8217;t
wake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Boy felt that he was in high society, so
he said, politely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious Prince, a million thanks; but how
can I keep awake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only for one night, young sir. Come with
me. My sister, Goody Two-Shoes, lives close by,
and she may help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went along through the twilight and
walked far, until Little Boy was ready to drop.
At last Fine Ear said that as he heard his sister
breathing, she could not be more than three miles
away. As they climbed a great hill, it became
dark, and Little Boy grew more and more sleepy,
and could not see his way, and tumbled about so
much that at last the Prince stood still and said:
&ldquo;My dear fellow, this won&#8217;t do; you will be in
Dream-land before I can pinch you.&rdquo; Then he
whistled, and a little silver star&mdash;a shining white
light&mdash;fell out of the fairy sky and rolled beside
them, making all the road as bright as day, and
quite waking up Little Boy.</p>

<p>After this they walked on, and the Prince said
he would ask Jack the Giant-killer to supper.
Little Boy replied that he would be proud to meet
him. Just as they came near to the house, which
was built of pearls and rubies, the Prince said:
&ldquo;Alas! here comes that tiresome fool, Humpty
Dumpty.&rdquo; When Little Boy looked, he saw a
short man very crooked in the back, and with a
head all to one side, not having been well mended
by the doctors, as you may recall. Also his
mouth was very large, which was a pity, because
when he stopped before them and bowed in a
polite way, all of a sudden he opened this great
mouth and gaped; and when poor, sleepy Little
Boy saw this, what could he do but gape for company,
and at once fall down sound asleep before
the kind Prince could move?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! fool,&rdquo; said Fine Ear, &ldquo;why must you
gape at a mortal? You knew what would happen.
It was lucky you did not sneeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there lay Little Boy sound asleep,
and what was to be done? At last he was carried
into the house of Goody Two-Shoes and put on a
bed. Every one knew that he could not be waked
up, and so they put fairy food in his mouth twice
a day, and just let him alone, so that for several
years he slept soundly, and by reason of being
fed with fairy food grew tall and beautiful; what
was more strange, his clothes grew also.</p>

<p>At the end of seven years a great Sayer of
Sooth came by on his way to visit his fairy godmother,
and when he heard about Little Boy&#8217;s
sleep he stood still and uttered a loud Sooth.
When Goody Two-Shoes heard it she was sorry,
because it was told her that Little Boy would
never wake until he was carried back to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
country of mortals, when he would wake up at
once. Now by this time she had come to love
him very much, and was sorry to part with him,
because in seven years he had never spoken one
cross word!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/img91.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;she put around little boy&#8217;s neck a fairy kiss&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Sooths must be obeyed; so she sent for a
gentle Giant, and told him to carry Little Boy to
the Queen&#8217;s tailor and to dress him like a fairy
Prince, and to set him down on the roadside
near his father&#8217;s house. Then when the Giant
took him up in his great arms, all sound asleep,
she put around Little Boy&#8217;s neck a fairy kiss tied
fast to a gold chain, and this was for good luck.
After this the Giant walked away, and Goody
Two-Shoes went into the house and cried for two
days and a night.</p>

<p>When the Giant came to Common-Folks&#8217;-land,
he laid Little Boy beside the high-road and went
home. Toward evening, the King&#8217;s daughter
went by, and seeing Little Boy, who, as I have
said, was now grown tall and dressed all in velvet
and jewels, she came and stood by him, and when
she saw the fairy kiss hanging around his neck
she knelt down and kissed him. Then all the old
ladies cried, &ldquo;Fy! for shame!&rdquo; but you know she
could not help it. As for Little Boy, he kept ever
so still, being now wide awake, but having hopes
that she would kiss him again, which she did,
twice. As he still seemed to sleep, he was put in
the Princess&#8217;s chariot and taken to the King&#8217;s
palace.</p>

<p>At last, when every one had looked at him,
they put him on a bed, and when morning came
he opened his eyes, and began to walk around to
stretch his legs. But as he went downstairs he
met the King, who said to him: &ldquo;Fair Sir, what
is the name of thy beautiful self?&rdquo; To which he
answered: &ldquo;I am called Prince Little Boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha!
ha!&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;That was the name of the
bad brick-maker. Perchance thou art he.&rdquo; Then
he called his guards, and Little Boy was at once
shut up in a huge tower, for the King was not
quite sure, or else he would have put him to
death at once. But after Little Boy had been
there three days he put his head out of a window
and saw the Princess in the garden. Then he
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet lady, look up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they have sent for thy
mother, and if she says thou art Little Boy they
will kill thee, and, alas! I love thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;come to this tower at midnight,
and cast me kisses a many through the
night; blow a kiss to the north, blow a kiss to the
south, to the east, to the west, from the flower
of thy mouth and it may be that one will float
to Fairy-land and fetch us help, for if not, I be but
a dead man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this she did because she was brave and
loved him. She stood in the dark and blew kisses
to the four winds, and then listened, and by and
by came a noise like great wings, and all the air
was filled with strange, sweet odors, the like of
which that Princess never smelled again.</p>

<p>As for Little Boy, he was aware of a Giant
who was as tall as the tower. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the
Giant, &ldquo;it is told me that you must keep your
eyes shut until I bid them to open. I have brought
the Kiss Queen to pay you a visit. No man has
ever seen her; for if he did he could never,
never kiss or be kissed of any mortal lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Little Boy, &ldquo;the Princess is more
sweet than any that kiss in Fairy-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said the Giant, &ldquo;your education has
been but slight, or else you would know that all
kisses are made in Fairy-land. But shut your
eyes and stir not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Little Boy did close his two eyes. At
once he felt a tiny kiss from lips that might have
been as long as one&#8217;s fingernail, and once he was
kissed on each cheek and once on his chin, and
then he felt faint for a moment. All was still
for a while, until the Giant said: &ldquo;You are lucky.
Open your eyes, Fair Sir,&rdquo; and went away.</p>

<p>Next day all the people came to see the King
try Little Boy. When Little Boy saw his mother
he was almost ready to cry, but he kept still and
waited. Then the King said to her: &ldquo;Tell me, is
this your son? and do not deceive me, or dreadful
things will happen to you and to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the good woman looked at him with
care. &ldquo;This looks like my son,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but it
is not my son, because this young man has a
dimple on each cheek and one on his chin. Who
ever saw any one with three dimples?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the King heard this and Little Boy&#8217;s
father declared also that his lost son had no
dimples, the King bade them all go free, and
said he had been now nine years angry about those
bricks, and that whoever would find the bad
brick-maker should marry the Princess. When
Prince Little Boy heard this he said that he was
the bad boy who had made those bricks. But the
King was as good as his word, and ordered that
the Prince should marry the Princess, and not
have his head cut off, because the Princess did
wisely say that a husband with no head wasn&#8217;t
much good as a husband. Therefore they were
married that minute, and I have heard that they
spent their honeymoon in Fairy-land. And this
is the end of the Story of Prince Little Boy.</p>

<h2>THE BEE-MAN OF ORN<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY FRANK R. STOCKTON</strong></p>


<p>In the ancient country of Orn there lived an
old man who was called the Bee-man, because his
whole time was spent in the company of bees. He
lived in a small hut, which was nothing more than
an immense bee-hive, for these little creatures had
built their honeycombs in every corner of the one
room it contained&mdash;on the shelves, under the little
table, all about the rough bench on which the old
man sat, and even about the head-board and along
the sides of his low bed.</p>

<p>All day the air of the room was thick with buzzing
insects, but this did not interfere in any way
with the old Bee-man, who walked in among
them, ate his meals, and went to sleep, without
the slightest fear of being stung.</p>

<p>He had lived with the bees so long, they had
become so accustomed to him, and his skin was
so tough and hard, that the bees no more thought
of stinging him than they would of stinging a
tree or a stone. A swarm of bees had made their
hive in a pocket of his old leathern doublet; and
when he put on this coat to take one of his long
walks in the forest in search of wild bees&#8217; nests,
he was very glad to have this hive with him, for,
if he did not find any wild honey, he would put
his hand in his pocket and take out a piece of a
comb for a luncheon. The bees in his pocket
worked very industriously, and he was always
certain of having something to eat with him
wherever he went. He lived principally upon
honey; and when he needed bread or meat, he
carried some fine combs to a village not far away
and bartered them for other food. He was ugly,
untidy, shrivelled, and brown. He was poor, and
the bees seemed to be his only friends. But, for
all that, he was happy and contented; he had all
the honey he wanted, and his bees, whom he considered
the best company in the world, were as
friendly and sociable as they could be, and seemed
to increase in number every day.</p>

<p>One day there stopped at the hut of the Bee-man
a Junior Sorcerer. This young person, who was
a student of magic, was much interested in the
Bee-man, whom he had often noticed in his wanderings,
and he considered him an admirable subject
for study. He had got a great deal of useful
practice by trying to find out, by the various rules
and laws of sorcery, exactly why the old Bee-man
did not happen to be something that he was
not, and why he was what he happened to be.
He had studied a long time at this matter, and
had found out something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, when the Bee-man
came out of his hut, &ldquo;that you have been transformed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said the other,
much surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have surely heard of animals and human
beings who have been magically transformed
into different kinds of creatures?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard of these things,&rdquo; said the
Bee-man; &ldquo;but what have I been transformed
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is more than I know,&rdquo; said the Junior
Sorcerer. &ldquo;But one thing is certain; you ought
to be changed back. If you will find out what you
have been transformed from, I will see that you
are made all right again. Nothing would please
me better than to attend to such a case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, having a great many things to study and
investigate, the Junior Sorcerer went his way.</p>

<p>This information greatly disturbed the mind of
the Bee-man. If he had been changed from something
else, he ought to be that other thing, whatever
it was. He ran after the young man, and
overtook him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you know, kind sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have
been transformed, you surely are able to tell me
what it is that I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Junior Sorcerer, &ldquo;my studies
have not proceeded far enough for that. When
I become a Senior I can tell you all about it.
But, in the meantime, it will be well for you to
try to find out for yourself your original form;
and when you have done that, I will get some of
the learned masters of my art to restore you to
it. It will be easy enough to do that, but you
could not expect them to take the time and trouble
to find out what it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with these words, he hurried away, and
was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>Greatly disturbed, the Bee-man retraced his
steps, and went to his hut. Never before had he
heard anything which had so troubled him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what I was transformed from?&rdquo; he
thought, seating himself on his rough bench.
&ldquo;Could it have been a giant, or a powerful prince,
or some gorgeous being whom the magicians or
the fairies wished to punish? It may be that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was a dog or a horse, or perhaps a fiery dragon
or a horrid snake. I hope it was not one of
these. But whatever it was, everyone has certainly
a right to his original form, and I am resolved
to find out mine. I will start early to-morrow
morning; and I am sorry now that I have not
more pockets to my old doublet, so that I might
carry more bees and more honey for my journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the day in making a hive
of twigs and straw; and, having transferred to
this a number of honeycombs and a colony of
bees which had just swarmed, he rose before sunrise
the next day, and having put on his leathern
doublet and having bound his new hive to his
back, he set forth on his quest, the bees who were
to accompany him buzzing around him like a cloud.</p>

<p>As the Bee-man pressed through the little village
the people greatly wondered at his queer
appearance, with the hive upon his back. &ldquo;The
Bee-man is going on a long journey this time,&rdquo;
they said; but no one imagined the strange business
on which he was bent.</p>

<p>About noon he sat down under a tree, near a
beautiful meadow covered with blossoms, and ate
a little honey. Then he untied his hive and
stretched himself out on the grass to rest. As
he gazed upon his bees hovering about him, some
going out to the blossoms in the sunshine, and
some returning laden with the sweet pollen, he
said to himself: &ldquo;They know just what they
have to do, and they do it; but alas for me! I
know not what I may have to do. And yet, whatever
it may be, I am determined to do it. In
some way or other I will find out what was my
original form, and then I will have myself changed
back to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now the thought came to him that perhaps
his original form might have been something
very disagreeable, or even horrid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it does not matter,&rdquo; he said sturdily.
&ldquo;Whatever I was that shall I be again. It is not
right for anyone to keep a form which does not
properly belong to him. I have no doubt I shall
discover my original form in the same way that
I find the trees in which the wild bees hive.
When I first catch sight of a bee tree I am drawn
toward it, I know not how. Something says to
me: &lsquo;That is what you are looking for.&rsquo; In the
same way I believe that I shall find my original
form. When I see it, I shall be drawn toward
it. Something will say to me: &lsquo;That is it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Bee-man was rested he started off
again, and in about an hour he entered a fair
domain. Around him were beautiful lawns, grand
trees, and lovely gardens; while at a little distance
stood the stately palace of the Lord of the Domain.
Richly dressed people were walking about or
sitting in the shade of the trees and arbors;
splendidly equipped horses were waiting for their
riders; and everywhere were seen signs of wealth
and gayety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Bee-man to himself, &ldquo;that
I should like to stop here for a time. If it should
happen that I was originally like any of these
happy creatures it would please me much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He untied his hive, and hid it behind some
bushes, and, taking off his old doublet, laid that
beside it. It would not do to have his bees flying
about him if he wished to go among the inhabitants
of this fair domain.</p>

<p>For two days the Bee-man wandered about the
palace and its grounds, avoiding notice as much as
possible, but looking at everything. He saw handsome
men and lovely ladies; the finest horses,
dogs, and cattle that were ever known; beautiful
birds in cages, and fishes in crystal globes; and
it seemed to him that the best of all living-things
were here collected.</p>

<p>At the close of the second day the Bee-man
said to himself: &ldquo;There is one being here toward
whom I feel very much drawn, and that is the
Lord of the Domain. I cannot feel certain that
I was once like him, but it would be a very fine
thing if it were so; and it seems impossible for
me to be drawn toward any other being in the
domain when I look upon him, so handsome, rich,
and powerful. But I must observe him more
closely, and feel more sure of the matter, before
applying to the sorcerers to change me back into a
lord of a fair domain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the Bee-man saw the Lord of
the Domain walking in his gardens. He slipped
along the shady paths, and followed him so as to
observe him closely, and find out if he were really
drawn toward this noble and handsome being.
The Lord of the Domain walked on for some
time, not noticing that the Bee-man was behind
him. But suddenly turning, he saw the little old
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, you vile beggar?&rdquo;
he cried; and he gave him a kick that sent him
into some bushes which grew by the side of the
path.</p>

<p>The Bee-man scrambled to his feet, and ran as
fast as he could to the place where he had hidden
his hive and his old doublet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am certain of anything,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it
is that I was never a person who would kick a
poor old man. I will leave this place. I was
transformed from nothing that I see here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He now traveled for a day or two longer, and
then he came to a great black mountain, near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
bottom of which was an opening like the mouth
of a cave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/img95.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;he was extremely lively and active, and came bounding
toward them&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>This mountain he had heard was filled with
caverns and underground passages, which were
the abodes of dragons, evil spirits, and horrid
creatures of all kinds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; said the Bee-man with a sigh, &ldquo;I
suppose I ought to visit this place. If I am going
to do this thing properly, I should look on all
sides of the subject, and I may have been one of
those horrid creatures myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he went to the mountain, and as
he approached the opening of the passage which
led into its inmost recesses, he saw, sitting upon
the ground, and leaning his back against a tree,
a Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said this individual when he saw
the Bee-man. &ldquo;Are you going inside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Bee-man, &ldquo;that is what I intend
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth, slowly rising
to his feet, &ldquo;I think I will go with you. I was
told that if I went in there I should get my
energies toned up, and they need it very much;
but I did not feel equal to entering by myself,
and I thought I would wait until some one came
along. I am very glad to see you, and we will
go in together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two went into the cave, and they had
proceeded but a short distance when they met
a very little creature, whom it was easy to recognize
as a Very Imp. He was about two feet
high, and resembled in color a freshly polished
pair of boots. He was extremely lively and active,
and came bounding toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you two people come here for?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth, &ldquo;to have my
energies toned up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to the right place,&rdquo; said the
Very Imp. &ldquo;We will tone you up. And what
does that old Bee-man want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been transformed from something, and
wants to find out what it is. He thinks he may
have been one of the things in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not wonder if that were so,&rdquo; said the
Very Imp, rolling his head on one side, and eying
the Bee-man with a critical gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Very Imp; &ldquo;he can go
around, and pick out his previous existence. We
have here all sorts of vile creepers, crawlers,
hissers, and snorters. I suppose he thinks anything
will be better than a Bee-man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not because I want to be better than I
am,&rdquo; said the Bee-man, &ldquo;that I started out on
this search. I have simply an honest desire to
become what I originally was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh; that is it, is it?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;There
is an idiotic moon-calf here with a clam head,
which must be just what you used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the Bee-man. &ldquo;You have not
the least idea what an honest purpose is. I shall
go about and see for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said the Very Imp, &ldquo;and I will attend
to this fellow who wants to be toned up.&rdquo;
So saying he joined the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the Youth, &ldquo;do you black
and shine yourself every morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;it is water-proof varnish.
You want to be invigorated, don&#8217;t you? Well, I
will tell you a splendid way to begin. You see
that Bee-man has put down his hive and his coat
with the bees in it. Just wait till he gets out
of sight, and then catch a lot of those bees, and
squeeze them flat. If you spread them on a
sticky rag, and make a plaster, and put it on the
small of your back, it will invigorate you like
everything, especially if some of the bees are not
quite dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth, looking at him
with his mild eyes, &ldquo;but if I had energy enough
to catch a bee I would be satisfied. Suppose you
catch a lot for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The subject is changed,&rdquo; said the Very Imp.
&ldquo;We are now about to visit the spacious chamber
of the King of the Snap-dragons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a flower,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find him a gay old blossom,&rdquo; said the
other. &ldquo;When he has chased you round his room,
and has blown sparks at you, and has snorted and
howled, and cracked his tail, and snapped his
jaws like a pair of anvils, your energies will be
toned up higher than ever before in your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth;
&ldquo;but I think I will begin with something a little
milder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;there is a flat-tailed
Demon of the Gorge in here. He is
generally asleep, and, if you say so, you can slip
into the farthest corner of his cave, and I&#8217;ll solder
his tail to the opposite wall. Then he will rage
and roar, but he can&#8217;t get at you, for he doesn&#8217;t
reach all the way across his cave; I have measured
him. It will tone you up wonderfully to sit there
and watch him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the Languid Youth; &ldquo;but I
would rather stay outside and let you go up in
the corner. The performance in that way will be
more interesting to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are dreadfully hard to please,&rdquo; said the
Very Imp. &ldquo;I have offered them to you loose,
and I offered them fastened to a wall, and now the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
best thing I can do is to give you a chance at one
of them that can&#8217;t move at all. It is the Ghastly
Griffin, and is enchanted. He can&#8217;t stir so much
as the tip of his whiskers for a thousand years.
You can go to his cave and examine him just as
if he were stuffed, and then you can sit on his
back and think how it would be if you should live
to be a thousand years old, and he should wake up
while you are sitting there. It would be easy to
imagine a lot of horrible things he would do to
you when you look at his open mouth with its
awful fangs, his dreadful claws, and his horrible
wings all covered with spikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that might suit me,&rdquo; said the Languid
Youth. &ldquo;I would much rather imagine the exercises
of these monsters than to see them really
going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said the Very Imp; and he
led the way to the cave of the Ghastly Griffin.</p>

<p>The Bee-man went by himself through a great
part of the mountain, and looked into many of its
gloomy caves and recesses, recoiling in horror
from most of the dreadful monsters who met his
eyes. While he was wandering about, an awful
roar was heard resounding through the passages
of the mountain, and soon there came flapping
along an enormous dragon, with body black as
night, and wings and tail of fiery red. In his
great fore-claws he bore a little baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed the Bee-man. &ldquo;He is
taking that little creature to his cave to devour it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw the dragon enter a cave not far away,
and, following, looked in. The dragon was
crouched upon the ground with the little baby
lying before him. It did not seem to be hurt, but
was frightened and crying. The monster was
looking upon it with delight, as if he intended to
make a dainty meal of it as soon as his appetite
should be a little stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too bad!&rdquo; thought the Bee-man. &ldquo;Somebody
ought to do something.&rdquo; And turning
around, he ran away as fast as he could.</p>

<p>He ran through various passages until he came
to the spot where he had left his bee-hive. Picking
it up, he hurried back, carrying the hive in
his two hands before him. When he reached
the cave of the dragon, he looked in and saw the
monster still crouched over the weeping child.
Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, the Bee-man
rushed into the cave and threw his hive straight
into the face of the dragon. The bees, enraged
by the shock, rushed upon the head, mouth, eyes,
and nose of the dragon.</p>

<p>The great monster, astounded by this sudden
attack, and driven almost wild by the numberless
stings of the bees, sprang back to the farthest
corner of his cave, still followed by the bees, at
whom he flapped wildly with his great wings and
struck with his paws. While the dragon was
thus engaged with the bees, the Bee-man rushed
forward, and seizing the child, he hurried away.
He did not stop to pick up his doublet, but kept on
until he saw the Very Imp hopping along on one
leg, and rubbing his back and shoulders with his
hands, and stopped to inquire what was the matter,
and what had become of the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is no kind of a fellow,&rdquo; said the Very
Imp. &ldquo;He disappointed me dreadfully. I took
him up to the Ghastly Griffin, and told him the
thing was enchanted, and that he might sit on its
back and think about what it could do if it was
awake; and when he came near it the wretched
creature opened its eyes, and raised its head, and
then you ought to have seen how mad that simpleton
was. He made a dash at me and seized me
by the ears; he kicked and beat me till I can
scarcely move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His energies must have been toned up a good
deal,&rdquo; said the Bee-man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toned up! I should say so!&rdquo; cried the other.
&ldquo;I raised a howl, and a Scissor-jawed Clipper
came out of his hole, and got after him; but that
lazy fool ran so fast that he could not be caught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bee-man now ran on and soon overtook the
Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be in a hurry now,&rdquo; said the
latter, &ldquo;for the rules of this institution don&#8217;t
allow the creatures inside to come out of this
opening, or to hang around it. If they did, they
would frighten away visitors. They go in and
out of holes in the upper part of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with that baby?&rdquo;
said the Languid Youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall carry it along with me,&rdquo; said the Bee-man,
&ldquo;as I go on with my search, and perhaps I
may find its mother. If I do not, I shall give it
to somebody in that little village yonder. Anything
would be better than leaving it to be devoured
by that horrid dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me carry it, I feel quite strong enough
now to carry a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Bee-man; &ldquo;but I can take
it myself. I like to carry something, and I have
now neither my hive nor my doublet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very well that you had to leave them behind,&rdquo;
said the Youth, &ldquo;for the bees would have
stung the baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My bees never sting babies,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They probably never had a chance,&rdquo; remarked
his companion.</p>

<p>They soon entered the village, and after walking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
a short distance the Youth exclaimed: &ldquo;Do you
see that woman over there sitting at the door of
her house? She has beautiful hair, and she is
tearing it all to pieces. She should not be allowed
to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Bee-man. &ldquo;Her friends should
tie her hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is the mother of this child,&rdquo; said
the Youth, &ldquo;and if you give it to her she will
no longer think of tearing her hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Bee-man, &ldquo;you don&#8217;t really
think this is her child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you go over and see,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>The Bee-man hesitated a moment, and then he
walked toward the woman. Hearing him coming,
she raised her head, and when she saw the
child she rushed toward it, snatched it into her
arms, and screaming with joy she covered it with
kisses. Then with happy tears she begged to
know the story of the rescue of her child, whom
she never expected to see again; and she loaded
the Bee-man with thanks and blessings. The
friends and neighbors gathered around, and there
was great rejoicing. The mother urged the Bee-man
and the Youth to stay with her, and rest and
refresh themselves, which they were glad to do,
as they were tired and hungry.</p>

<p>They remained at the cottage all night, and in
the afternoon of the next day the Bee-man said
to the Youth: &ldquo;It may seem an odd thing to you,
but never in all my life have I felt myself drawn
toward any living being as I am drawn toward
this baby. Therefore I believe that I have been
transformed from a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the Youth. &ldquo;It is my opinion
that you have hit the truth. And now would you
like to be changed back to your original form?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would!&rdquo; said the Bee-man. &ldquo;I have
the strongest yearning to be what I originally
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Youth, who had now lost every trace of
languid feeling, took a great interest in the matter,
and early the next morning started off to tell
the Junior Sorcerer that the Bee-man had discovered
what he had been transformed from, and
desired to be changed back to it.</p>

<p>The Junior Sorcerer and his learned Masters
were filled with delight when they heard this report,
and they at once set out for the mother&#8217;s
cottage. And there by magic arts the Bee-man
was changed back into a baby. The mother was
so grateful for what the Bee-man had done for
her that she agreed to take charge of this baby,
and to bring it up as her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a grand thing for him,&rdquo; said the
Junior Sorcerer, &ldquo;and I am glad that I studied
his case. He will now have a fresh start in life,
and will have a chance to become something
better than a miserable old man living in a
wretched hut with no friends or companions but
buzzing bees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Junior Sorcerer and his Masters then returned
to their homes, happy in the success of
their great performance; and the Youth went back
to his home anxious to begin a life of activity
and energy.</p>

<p>Years and years afterward, when the Junior
Sorcerer had become a Senior and was very old
indeed, he passed through the country of Orn, and
noticed a small hut about which swarms of bees
were flying. He approached it, and looking in at
the door he saw an old man in a leathern doublet,
sitting at a table, eating honey. By his magic art
he knew this was the baby which had been transformed
from the Bee-man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sorcerer, &ldquo;he
has grown into the same thing again!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN</strong></p>


<p>The Flower family lived in a little house in a
broad grassy meadow, which sloped a few rods
from their front door down to a gentle, silvery
river. Right across the river rose a lovely dark
green mountain, and when there was a rainbow,
as there frequently was, nothing could have looked
more enchanting than it did rising from the opposite
bank of the stream with the wet, shadowy
mountain for a background. All the Flower
family would invariably run to their front windows
and their door to see it.</p>

<p>The Flower family numbered nine: Father and
Mother Flower and seven children. Father
Flower was an unappreciated poet, Mother Flower
was very much like all mothers, and the seven
children were very sweet and interesting. Their
first names all matched beautifully with their last
name, and with their personal appearance. For
instance, the oldest girl, who had soft blue eyes
and flaxen curls, was called Flax Flower: the
little boy, who came next, and had very red cheeks
and loved to sleep late in the morning, was called
Poppy Flower, and so on. This charming suitableness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of their names was owing to Father
Flower. He had a theory that a great deal of
the misery and discord in the world comes from
things not matching properly as they should; and
he thought there ought to be a certain correspondence
between all things that were in juxtaposition
to each other, just as there ought to be between
the last two words of a couplet of poetry. But
he found, very often, there was no correspondence
at all, just as words in poetry do not always rhyme
when they should. However, he did his best to
remedy it. He saw that every one of his children&#8217;s
names was suitable and accorded with
their personal characteristics; and in his flower-garden&mdash;for
he raised flowers for the market&mdash;only
those of complementary colors were allowed
to grow in adjoining beds, and, as often as
possible, they rhymed in their names. But that
was a more difficult matter to manage, and very
few flowers were rhymed, or, if they were, none
rhymed correctly. He had a bed of box next to
one of phlox, and a trellis of woodbine grew next
to one of eglantine, and a thicket of elderblows
was next to one of rose; but he was forced to
let his violets and honeysuckles and many others
go entirely unrhymed&mdash;this disturbed him considerably,
but he reflected that it was not his fault,
but that of the man who made the language and
named the different flowers&mdash;he should have
looked to it that those of complementary colors
had names to rhyme with each other, then all
would have been harmonious and as it should have
been.</p>

<p>Father Flower had chosen this way of earning
his livelihood when he realized that he was doomed
to be an unappreciated poet, because it suited so
well with his name; and if the flowers had only
rhymed a little better he would have been very
well contented. As it was, he never grumbled.
He also saw to it that the furniture in his little
house and the cooking utensils rhymed as nearly
as possible, though that too was oftentimes a difficult
matter to bring about, and required a vast
deal of thought and hard study. The table always
stood under the gable end of the roof, the foot-stool
always stood where it was cool, and the big
rocking-chair in a glare of sunlight; the lamp,
too, he kept down cellar where it was damp. But
all these were rather far-fetched, and sometimes
quite inconvenient. Occasionally there would be
an article that he could not rhyme until he had
spent years of thought over it, and when he did
it would disturb the comfort of the family greatly.
There was the spider. He puzzled over that exceedingly,
and when he rhymed it at last, Mother
Flower or one of the little girls had always to
take the spider beside her, when she sat down,
which was of course quite troublesome. The
kettle he rhymed first with nettle, and hung a
bunch of nettle over it, till all the children got
dreadfully stung. Then he tried settle, and hung
the kettle over the settle. But that was no place
for it; they had to go without their tea, and everybody
who sat on the settle bumped his head
against the kettle. At last it occurred to Father
Flower that if he should make a slight change in
the language the kettle could rhyme with the skillet,
and sit beside it on the stove, as it ought,
leaving harmony out of the question, to do. Accordingly
all the children were instructed to call
the skillet a skettle, and the kettle stood by its
side on the stove ever afterward.</p>

<p>The house was a very pretty one, although it
was quite rude and very simple. It was built of
logs and had a thatched roof, which projected
far out over the walls. But it was all overrun
with the loveliest flowering vines imaginable, and,
inside, nothing could have been more exquisitely
neat and homelike; although there was only one
room and a little garret over it. All around the
house were the flower-beds and the vine-trellises
and the blooming shrubs, and they were always
in the most beautiful order. Now, although all
this was very pretty to see, and seemingly very
simple to bring to pass, yet there was a vast deal
of labor in it for some one; for flowers do not
look so trim and thriving without tending, and
houses do not look so spotlessly clean without constant
care. All the Flower family worked hard;
even the littlest children had their daily tasks set
them. The oldest girl, especially, little Flax
Flower, was kept busy from morning till night
taking care of her younger brothers and sisters,
and weeding flowers. But for all that she was a
very happy little girl, as indeed were the whole
family, as they did not mind working, and loved
each other dearly.</p>

<p>Father Flower, to be sure, felt a little sad sometimes;
for, although his lot in life was a pleasant
one, it was not exactly what he would have
chosen. Once in a while he had a great longing
for something different. He confided a great
many of his feelings to Flax Flower; she was
more like him than any of the other children, and
could understand him even better than his wife, he
thought.</p>

<p>One day, when there had been a heavy shower
and a beautiful rainbow, he and Flax were out
in the garden tying up some rose-bushes, which
the rain had beaten down, and he said to her how
he wished he could find the Pot of Gold at the
end of the rainbow. Flax, if you will believe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
me, had never heard of it; so he had to tell
her all about it, and also say a little poem he had
made about it to her.</p>

<p>The poem ran something in this way:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
O what is it shineth so golden-clear<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the rainbow&#8217;s foot on the dark green hill?</span><br />
&#8217;Tis the Pot of Gold, that for many a year<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has shone, and is shining and dazzling still.</span><br />
And whom is it for, O Pilgrim, pray?<br />
For thee, Sweetheart, shouldst thou go that way.</p>

<p>Flax listened with her soft blue eyes very wide
open. &ldquo;I suppose if we should find that pot of
gold it would make us very rich, wouldn&#8217;t it,
father?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied her father; &ldquo;we could then have
a grand house, and keep a gardener, and a maid
to take care of the children, and we should no
longer have to work so hard.&rdquo; He sighed as he
spoke, and tears stood in his gentle blue eyes,
which were very much like Flax&#8217;s. &ldquo;However,
we shall never find it,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&#8217;t we run ever so fast when we
saw the rainbow,&rdquo; inquired Flax, &ldquo;and get the
Pot of Gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be foolish, child!&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;you
could not possibly reach it before the rainbow
was quite faded away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Flax, but she fell to thinking as
she tied up the dripping roses.</p>

<p>The next rainbow they had she eyed very
closely, standing out on the front doorstep in the
rain, and she saw that one end of it seemed to
touch the ground at the foot of a pine-tree on the
side of the mountain, which was quite conspicuous
amongst its fellows, it was so tall. The other
end had nothing especial to mark it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try the end where the tall pine-tree is
first,&rdquo; said Flax to herself, &ldquo;because that will be
the easiest to find&mdash;if the Pot of Gold isn&#8217;t there
I will try to find the other end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days after that it was very hot and
sultry, and at noon the thunder heads were piled
high all around the horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t doubt but we shall have showers this
afternoon,&rdquo; said Father Flower, when he came in
from the garden for his dinner.</p>

<p>After the dinner-dishes were washed up, and
the baby rocked to sleep, Flax came to her mother
with a petition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;won&#8217;t you give me a holiday
this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where do you want to go, Flax?&rdquo; said
her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go over on the mountain and hunt
for wild flowers,&rdquo; replied Flax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think it is going to rain, child, and you
will get wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&#8217;t hurt me any, mother,&rdquo; said Flax,
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&#8217;t know as I care,&rdquo; said her mother,
hesitatingly. &ldquo;You have been a very good industrious
girl, and deserve a little holiday. Only
don&#8217;t go so far that you cannot soon run home if
a shower should come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Flax curled her flaxen hair and tied it up
with a blue ribbon, and put on her blue and white
checked dress. By the time she was ready to go
the clouds over in the northwest were piled up
very high and black, and it was quite late in the
afternoon. Very likely her mother would not
have let her go if she had been at home, but
she had taken the baby, who had waked from his
nap, and gone to call on her nearest neighbor, half
a mile away. As for her father, he was busy in
the garden, and all the other children were with
him, and they did not notice Flax when she stole
out of the front door. She crossed the river on a
pretty arched stone bridge nearly opposite the
house, and went directly into the woods on the
side of the mountain.</p>

<p>Everything was very still and dark and solemn
in the woods. They knew about the storm that
was coming. Now and then Flax heard the leaves
talking in queer little rustling voices. She inherited
the ability to understand what they said
from her father. They were talking to each
other now in the words of her father&#8217;s song.
Very likely he had heard them saying it sometime,
and that was how he happened to know it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;O what is it shineth so golden-clear</span><br />
 At the rainbow&#8217;s foot on the dark green hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flax heard the maple-leaves inquire. And the
pine-leaves answered back:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;&#8217;Tis the Pot of Gold, that for many a year</span><br />
 Has shone, and is shining and dazzling still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the maple-leaves asked:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4.5em;">
&ldquo;And whom is it for, O Pilgrim, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the pine-leaves answered:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4.5em;">
&ldquo;For thee, Sweetheart, shouldst thou go that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flax did not exactly understand the sense of
the last question and answer between maple and
pine-leaves. But they kept on saying it over and
over as she ran along. She was going straight
to the tall pine-tree. She knew just where it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was, for she had often been there. Now the
rain-drops began to splash through the green
boughs, and the thunder rolled along the sky. The
leaves all tossed about in a strong wind and their
soft rustles grew into a roar, and the branches and
the whole tree caught it up and called out so loud,
as they writhed and twisted about that Flax was
almost deafened, the words of the song:</p>


<p style="margin-left: 4.5em;">
&ldquo;O what is it shineth so golden-clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flax sped along through the wind and the rain
and the thunder. She was very much afraid that
she should not reach the tall pine which was
quite a way distant before the sun shone out, and
the rainbow came.</p>

<p>The sun was already breaking through the
clouds when she came in sight of it, way up above
her on a rock. The rain-drops on the trees began
to shine like diamonds, and the words of the
song rushed out from their midst, louder and
sweeter:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 4.5em;">
&ldquo;O what is it shineth so golden-clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flax climbed for dear life. Red and green and
golden rays were already falling thick around
her, and at the foot of the pine-tree something
was shining wonderfully clear and bright.</p>

<p>At last she reached it, and just at that instant
the rainbow became a perfect one, and there at
the foot of the wonderful arch of glory was the
Pot of Gold. Flax could see it brighter than all
the brightness of the rainbow. She sank down
beside it and put her hand on it, then she closed
her eyes and sat still, bathed in red and green and
violet light&mdash;that, and the golden light from the
Pot, made her blind and dizzy. As she sat there
with her hand on the Pot of Gold at the foot of
the rainbow, she could hear the leaves over her
singing louder and louder, till the tones fairly
rushed like a wind through her ears. But this
time they only sang the last words of the song:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;And whom is it for, O Pilgrim, pray?</span><br />
 For thee, Sweetheart, shouldst thou go that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last she ventured to open her eyes. The
rainbow had faded almost entirely away, only a
few tender rose and green shades were arching
over her; but the Pot of Gold under her hand
was still there, and shining brighter than ever.
All the pine needles with which the ground
around it was thickly spread, were turned to
needles of gold, and some stray couplets of leaves
which were springing up through them were all
gilded.</p>

<p>Flax bent over it trembling and lifted the lid off
the pot. She expected, of course, to find it full
of gold pieces that would buy the grand house and
the gardener and the maid that her father had
spoken about. But to her astonishment, when
she had lifted the lid off and bent over the Pot
to look into it, the first thing she saw was the
face of her mother looking out of it at her. It
was smaller of course, but just the same loving,
kindly face she had left at home. Then, as she
looked longer, she saw her father smiling gently
up at her, then came Poppy and the baby and all
the rest of her dear little brothers and sisters
smiling up at her out of the golden gloom inside
the Pot. At last she actually saw the garden and
her father in it tying up the roses, and the pretty
little vine-covered house, and, finally, she could
see right into the dear little room where her
mother sat with the baby in her lap, and all the
others around her.</p>

<p>Flax jumped up. &ldquo;I will run home,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;it is late, and I do want to see them all dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she left the Golden Pot shining all alone
under the pine-tree, and ran home as fast as she
could.</p>

<p>When she reached the house it was almost twilight,
but her father was still in the garden.
Every rose and lily had to be tied up after the
shower, and he was but just finishing. He had
the tin milk pan hung on him like a shield, because
it rhymed with man. It certainly was a
beautiful rhyme, but it was very inconvenient.
Poor Mother Flower was at her wits&#8217; end to know
what to do without it, and it was very awkward
for Father Flower to work with it fastened to
him.</p>

<p>Flax ran breathlessly into the garden, and threw
her arms around her father&#8217;s neck and kissed
him. She bumped her nose against the milk pan,
but she did not mind that; she was so glad to see
him again. Somehow, she never remembered being
so glad to see him as she was now since she
had seen his face in the Pot of Gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear father,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;how glad I am to see
you! I found the Pot of Gold at the end of the
rainbow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, truly, father,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But it
was not full of gold, after all. You were in it,
and mother and the children and the house and
garden and&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were mistaken, dear,&rdquo; said her father,
looking at her with his gentle, sorrowful eyes.
&ldquo;You could not have found the true end of the
rainbow, nor the true Pot of Gold&mdash;that is surely
full of the most beautiful gold pieces, with an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
angel stamped on every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did, father,&rdquo; persisted Flax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go into your mother, Flax,&rdquo;
said her father; &ldquo;she will be anxious to see you.
I know better than you about the Pot of Gold at
the end of the rainbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Flax went sorrowfully into the house. There
was the tea-kettle singing beside the &ldquo;skettle,&rdquo;
which had some nice smelling soup in it, the table
was laid for supper, and there sat her mother with
the baby in her lap and the others all around her&mdash;just
as they had looked in the Pot of Gold.</p>

<p>Flax had never been so glad to see them before&mdash;and
if she didn&#8217;t hug and kiss them all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the Pot of Gold at the end of the
rainbow, mother,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;and it was not full
of gold, at all; but you and father and the children
looked out of it at me, and I saw the house
and garden and everything in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her lovingly. &ldquo;Yes, Flax
dear,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But father said I was mistaken,&rdquo; said Flax,
&ldquo;and did not find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well dear,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;your father is a
poet, and very wise; we will say no more about
it. You can sit down here and hold the baby
now, while I make the tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flax was perfectly ready to do that; and, as she
sat there with her darling little baby brother crowing
in her lap, and watched her pretty little
brothers and sisters and her dear mother, she
felt so happy that she did not care any longer
whether she found the true Pot of Gold or not.</p>

<p>But, after all, do you know, I think her father
was mistaken, and that she had.</p>

<h2>THE FAIRY THORN</h2>

<p class="center"><em>An Ulster Ballad</em></p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY SAMUEL FERGUSON</strong></p>


<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
&ldquo;Get up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning wheel,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For your father&#8217;s on the hill, and your mother is asleep:</span><br />
Come up above the crags, and we&#8217;ll dance a Highland reel<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around the fairy thorn on the steep.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
At Anna Grace&#8217;s door, &#8217;t was thus the maidens cried&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three merry maidens fair, in kirtles of the green;</span><br />
And Anna laid the sock and the weary wheel aside&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest of the four, I ween.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
They&#8217;re glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away in milky wavings of the neck and ankle bare;</span><br />
The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crags in the ghostly air;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
And linking hand in hand, and singing as they go,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The maids along the hillside have ta&#8217;en their fearless way,</span><br />
Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside the Fairy Hawthorn gray.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee;</span><br />
The rowan berries cluster o&#8217;er her low head, gray and dim,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ruddy kisses sweet to see.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem;</span><br />
And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds, they go&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, never carroled bird like them!</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That drinks away their voices in echoless repose;</span><br />
And dreamily the evening has stilled the haunted braes,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dreamier the gloaming grows.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
And sinking, one by one, like lark-notes from the sky,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the falcon&#8217;s shadow saileth across the open shaw,</span><br />
Are hushed the maidens&#8217; voices, as cowering down they lie<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the flutter of their sudden awe.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
For, from the air above, and the grassy ground beneath,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from the mountain-ashes and the old white thorn between,</span><br />
A power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they sink down together on the green.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
They sink together silent, and stealing side by side,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They fling their lovely arms o&#8217;er their drooping necks so fair;</span><br />
Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">For their shrinking necks again are bare.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
Thus clasped and prostrate all, with their heads together bowed,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soft o&#8217;er their bosoms beating&mdash;the only human sound&mdash;</span><br />
They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a river in the air, gliding round.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
Nor scream can raise, nor prayer can any say,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But wild, wild the terror of the speechless three;</span><br />
For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">By whom, they dare not look to see.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the curls elastic falling, as her head withdraws;</span><br />
They feel her sliding arms from their tranc&egrave;d arms unfold,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they dare not look to see the cause.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;</span><br />
And neither fear nor wonder can open their quivering eyes,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or their limbs from the cold ground raise.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
Till out of night the earth has rolled her dewy side,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below;</span><br />
When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The maidens&#8217; trance dissolveth so.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
They fly, the ghastly three, as swiftly as they may,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And told their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain&mdash;</span><br />
They pined away and died within the year and day,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ne&#8217;er was Anna Grace seen again.</span></p>

<h2><a name="DAYS" id="DAYS"></a>FAIRY DAYS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
Beside the old hall fire, upon my nurse&#8217;s knee,<br />
Of happy fairy days, what tales were told to me!<br />
I thought the world was once all peopled with princesses,<br />
And my heart would beat to hear their loves and their distresses.<br />
And many a quiet night, in slumber sweet and deep,<br />
The pretty fairy people would visit me in sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
I saw them in my dreams come flying east and west;<br />
With wondrous fairy gifts the newborn babe they blessed.<br />
One has brought a jewel, and one a crown of gold,<br />
And one has brought a curse, but she is wrinkled and old.<br />
The gentle queen turns pale to hear those words of sin,<br />
But the king, he only laughs, and bids the dance begin.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
The babe has grown to be the fairest of the land,<br />
And rides the forest green, a hawk upon her hand,<br />
An ambling palfrey white, a golden robe and crown;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen her in my dreams riding up and down:<br />
And heard the ogre laugh, as she fell into his snare,<br />
At the tender little creature, who wept and tore her hair.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
But ever when it seemed her need was at the sorest,<br />
A prince in shining mail comes prancing through the forest,<br />
A waving ostrich-plume, a buckler burnished bright;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen him in my dreams, good sooth! a gallant knight.<br />
His lips are coral red beneath a dark mustache;<br />
See how he waves his hand and how his blue eyes flash!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
&ldquo;Come forth, thou Paynim knight!&rdquo; he shouts in accents clear.<br />
The giant and the maid, both tremble his voice to hear.<br />
Saint Mary guard him well! he draws his falchion keen,<br />
The giant and the knight are fighting on the green.<br />
I see them in my dreams, his blade gives stroke on stroke,<br />
The giant pants and reels, and tumbles like an oak!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.5em;">
With what a blushing grace he falls upon his knee<br />
And takes the lady&#8217;s hand and whispers, &ldquo;You are free.&rdquo;<br />
Ah! happy childish tales of knight and fa&euml;rie!<br />
I waken from my dreams, but there&#8217;s ne&#8217;er a knight for me;<br />
I waken from my dreams, and wish that I could be<br />
A child by the old hall-fire upon my nurse&#8217;s knee!</p>

  Unheard and unespied,<br />
  Through keyholes we do glide;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">Over tables, stools, and shelves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">We trip it with our fairy elves.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
  And if the house be foul<br />
  With platter, dish, or bowl,<br />
  Up stairs we nimbly creep,<br />
  And find the sluts asleep;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">There we pinch their arms and thighs&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">None escapes, nor none espies.</span></p>

  But if the house be swept,<br />

  We praise the household maid,<br />
  And duly she is paid;<br />

<span style="margin-left: -1em;">Pearly drops of dew we drink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">In acorn cups, filled to the brink.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
  The brains of nightingales,<br />
  With unctuous fat of snails,<br />
  Between two cockles stewed,<br />
  Is meat that&#8217;s easily chewed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">Tails of worms, and marrow of mice,</span><br />

  Grace said, we dance a while,<br />
  And so the time beguile;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">And if the moon doth hide her head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">The glow-worm lights us home to bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 14em;">
  On tops of dewy grass<br />
  So nimbly do we pass,<br />
  The young and tender stalk<br />
  Ne&#8217;er bends when we do walk;<br />

Under the deeps of the ocean,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little Sea Princess dwells.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Sometimes she sees the shadows<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of great whales passing by,</span><br />
Or white-winged vessels sailing<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Between the sea and sky.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
And when through the waves she rises,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the breakers&#8217; roar,</span><br />
She hears the shouts of the children<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">At play on the sandy shore.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Or sees the ships&#8217; sides tower<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above like a wet, black wall;</span><br />
Or shouts to the roaring breakers,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And answers the sea-gull&#8217;s call.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
But, down in the quiet waters,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better she loves to play,</span><br />
Making a sea-weed garden&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purple and green and gray;</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
Stringing with pearls a necklace,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or learning curious spells</span><br />
From the water-witch, gray and ancient,<br />

<h2>THE ELF OF THE WOODLANDS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD FROM RICHARD HENGIST HORNE BY WILLIAM BYRON FORBUSH</strong></p>


<p>One morning when the summer sun was still
sleeping an Elf came up from below, tickling an
oak-tree&#8217;s foot, skipping like a flea, and whispering
mischievously to himself.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
&ldquo;With little legs straddling,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He dances about&mdash;</span><br />
Pretends to be waddling&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then leaps with a flout.</span><br />
Now he stops&mdash;<br />
Now he hops&mdash;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now cautiously trips</span><br />
On tiptoe<br />
And sliptoe<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scuttles and skips;</span><br />
Along the grass gliding,<br />
Half dancing, half sliding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pretty white cottage on the edge
of the wood, and, with everybody quiet within,
it also seemed asleep. Toward this cottage skipped
the Elf.</p>

<p>He was a little fellow, scarce five inches tall.
His body was as brown as the bark of a tree, all
mixed with green streaks and tarnished gold.
You could hardly see him as he went stooping
along against the green leaves and the brown
branches.</p>

<p>When he got to the sleeping cottage he climbed
up the lattice, and poked his sharp little nose into
every crevice. He pulled open a loose shutter,
tapped once or twice on the windows, and when
he found a broken pane&mdash;in he went!</p>

<p>In this cottage lived a girl named Toody. She
was not very big, as you can believe when I tell
you that all the shrubs in the garden were taller
than she, and all the flowers nodded over her head.
In this same house lived Toody&#8217;s cousins, Kitty,
and Crocus, and Twig, and Tiny&mdash;only Tiny was
a little dog, not a little boy. And here, too, lived
Grandmother Grey.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 9em;">
&ldquo;In spectacles, tucker and flower&#8217;d-chintz gown,<br />
Who always half smiled when trying to frown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother Grey took care of them all. At
five o&#8217;clock that morning she woke up. &ldquo;What
noise do I hear below?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is daylight,
but nobody is up I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Grandmother Grey threw off her skullcap
and bandage, and nightcap with all its ribbons,
bows and strings, and called out loudly: &ldquo;Come,
children, jump up quickly! There&#8217;s a rat in the
dairy! Come down with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Toody, and Crocus, and Kitty, and Twig,
in their nightgowns and nightcaps, ran scrambling
and laughing down stairs, with Tiny barking and
tumbling about between their legs. They crept
through the parlor, where all the shutters were
closed but one. Like cautious Indians they went
silently on, Dame Grey and the children in single
file, each holding on to the one before by the tail
of her nightgown.</p>

<p>Into the dairy they went, and stared about. Then
they huddled together in fear, for behind a milk-jug,
under the spout, they saw a quaint little
figure.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;It was golden, and greenish, and earthy brown,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a perking nose and a pointed chin;</span><br />
It had very bright eyes and a funny frown,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a russet-apple&#8217;s network skin.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>They all started to run in terror, but brave
Tiny sprang up and began to chase the Elf
round a milkpan.</p>

<p>Oh, what a race was there! They ran so fast
that the two small bodies were as one. They
looked like the dark band on the humming-top
when you spin it. And just as Tiny was about to
catch him, the Elf leaped into a pan, swam across
three pails of milk, climbed the wall and hid on a
shelf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve lost him; we&#8217;ve lost him!&rdquo; cried all
the children. But, just in time, Grandmother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Grey seized her jelly-bag, swung it across the
shelf, and into it was swept our little elfin friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, children,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Go up and dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children did not know what the old dame
was going to do next. She led the way into the
parlor. &ldquo;Tiny,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I depend on you
to keep watch for us.&rdquo; So Tiny stood like a
soldier, with both ears cocked and his nose down
bent, and watched every motion that was going on
in the bag, which stood up now like a tent on the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8217;Twas but a minute before the children were
down again, all dressed. The tea-kettle was singing,
and the hot rolls were on the table, and everybody
was ringing the bell all at once for more
eggs. But Tiny stood guard over the jelly-bag
tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the Elf is hungry and thirsty,&rdquo; said
Toody. So she slipped a saucer of milk under the
edge of the tent, and then, laughing, she rolled
in an egg. They all listened for ten minutes, and
then they plainly heard the crackling of the shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with the tea things!&rdquo; said Dame Grey to
Martha, the maid. &ldquo;And bring me my white
wicker bird-cage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the bird-cage was brought, and Grandmother
Grey took up the jelly-bag carefully, clapped its
mouth to the open cage-door, shook it, and&mdash;pop!
in went the Elf, and the cage door was made fast!
Did he moan? Did he complain? Not he. With
one spring and ten kicks he climbed to the pole and
seated himself there, with his hands on the pole.</p>

<p>Toody ran close to the cage, and so did Crocus
and Twig; and Kitty, a little farther off, stood
staring and smiling. But the Elf was not a bit
frightened. He sat swinging his little legs, with
his tongue in his left cheek and his left eye looking
down with a half-winking, impertinent air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Dame Grey, &ldquo;tell us who you are,
little Sir, and what you are. Do you know that
you have spoilt all my cream, and broken my best
china-cup? Speak up now! What have you to
say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf was very angry, but it would never do
to show it. So he tried to look as gentle as a
good child reading a book. He rubbed some of
the yellow of the egg off his chin, and stuck it on
his leg like a buttercup. He shrugged his shoulders
up in a bunch, and then, with a sneeze as
if he had caught cold in the forest, he began:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
&ldquo;Nine white witches sat in a circle close,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their backs against a greenwood tree,</span><br />
As around the dead-nettle&#8217;s summer stem<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its woolly white blossoms you see.</span><br />
Then from hedges and ditches, these old lady-witches,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took bird-weed and rag-weed and spear-grass for me,</span><br />
And they wove me a bower, &#8217;gainst the snow-storm or shower,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a dry old hollow beech tree.</span><br />
              <span style="margin-left: 6em;"><em>Twangle tee!</em></span><br />
<em>Ri-rigdum, dingle shade-laugh, tingle dee!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Grandmother Grey. &ldquo;You
can&#8217;t fool me with your nettles, and nonsense, and
hedges, and ditches. What do I care about all
that? You know as well as I do that you came
here to <em>steal cake</em> and <em>drink cream</em>. Besides, you
have broken my best china-cup!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf gave a sigh, and looked up in the air;
then took a glance at Martha&#8217;s broom, and as he
looked down he thought he saw Toody winking
at him. So he just smiled and said: &ldquo;I declare,
by the tom-tit&#8217;s folly, and the mole&#8217;s pin-hole eye,
and the woodpecker&#8217;s thorny tongue, that I have
told you the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noticing that Toody was still winking at him
he kept on, and told the following story:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day when I was loafing about in the wood
I heard a strange noise in the bushes. I peeped
over the edge, and there was a robin bathing in
the brook. It ruffled its feathers with a spattering
sound, made itself into a fussy ball, and threw up
a shower of water; but what I most noticed was
its eye&mdash;its eye!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its eye&mdash;its eye?&rdquo; broke in all the children.
&ldquo;What about its eye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Elf glanced again at Toody, and he saw
that this time she gave him a quiet nod, as much
as to say, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll find you a chance.&rdquo; So the Elf
gave a downward squint at the closed cage-door,
just for a hint. Then he scratched his cheek,
jumped down on the floor of the cage, and began
to act out a &ldquo;robin,&rdquo; just as if he were on the
stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its eye&mdash;its eye? Well, just as soon as it
caught a glimpse of me it bobbed&mdash;took wing&mdash;and
was out of sight. Then back it came again,
as if angry. It looked like an alderman lecturing
the poor, but meaning really to&mdash;<em>unlock the cage!</em>
I mean&mdash;to try to fool me. See! How high it
flies. Clear up to the tip-top of the tree. Look
at its large bright eye! There! There! See how
it bobs&mdash;makes a quick bow, just as I am doing&mdash;points
down its tail and up its nose&mdash;and off it
goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And out and off went the Elf!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run, Tiny, run! Oh, Kitty! Twig! The little
rascal is gone! Run, Toody, run! Ah, I caught
you; you are the one who loosened the cage-door.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Run, Tiny! Oh, Kitty, Twig, and Crocus, that
robin redbreast story was only meant to fool us!&rdquo;
Thus cried Grandmother Grey, till she was breathless.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
  &ldquo;Off they all ran trooping,<br />
  And hallooing and whooping,<br />
  Beneath the low boughs stooping,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Right through the wood,</span><br />
  For Grandmama Grey,<br />
  Like an old duck, led the way,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">When a string of ducks trudge to a flood.</span><br />
  Then came Kitty, side by side<br />
  With Toody, who oft cried;<br />
<span style="margin-left: -1em;">&lsquo;Oh, Kitty dear, was ever such rare fun, fun, fun!&rsquo;</span><br />
            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Crocus close to Twig,</span><br />
            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Both scampered in a jig,</span><br />
  For they knew the Elf his freedom-race had won, won, won!<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 2em;">As for him, the roguish Elf,</span><br />
        <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He took good care of himself;</span><br />
  His mites of legs they twinkled as he fled, fled, fled.<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He was scarcely seen, indeed,</span><br />
        <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He so glistened with his speed,</span><br />
  And his hair streamed out like silver grass behind his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dame Grey and the children chased the Elf
till they were hot and tired, and till the sun went
down; and by and by they gave up, and all went

<p class="center"><strong>BY EDMUND LEAMY</strong></p>


<p>A long, long time ago there lived in a little
hut in the midst of a bare, brown, lonely moor
an old woman and a young girl. The old woman
was withered, sour-tempered, and dumb. The
young girl was as sweet and as fresh as an opening
rosebud, and her voice was as musical as the
whisper of a stream in the woods in the hot
days of summer. The little hut, made of branches
woven closely together, was shaped like a bee-hive.
In the center of the hut a fire burned night
and day from year&#8217;s end to year&#8217;s end, though
it was never touched or tended by human hand.
In the cold days and nights of winter it gave out
light and heat that made the hut cozy and warm,
but in the summer nights and days it gave out
light only. With their heads to the wall of the
hut and their feet toward the fire were two
sleeping-couches&mdash;one of plain woodwork, in
which slept the old woman; the other was Finola&#8217;s.
It was of bog-oak, polished as a looking-glass,
and on it were carved flowers and birds of all
kinds that gleamed and shone in the light of the
fire. This couch was fit for a Princess, and a
Princess Finola was, though she did not know
it herself.</p>

<p>Outside the hut the bare, brown, lonely moor
stretched for miles on every side, but toward the
east it was bounded by a range of mountains
that looked to Finola blue in the daytime, but
which put on a hundred changing colors as the
sun went down. Nowhere was a house to be
seen, nor a tree, nor a flower, nor sign of any
living thing. From morning till night, nor hum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of bee, nor song of bird, nor voice of man, nor
any sound fell on Finola&#8217;s ear. When the storm
was in the air the great waves thundered on the
shore beyond the mountains, and the wind
shouted in the glens; but when it sped across the
moor it lost its voice, and passed as silently as
the dead. At first the silence frightened Finola,
but she got used to it after a time, and often
broke it by talking to herself and singing.</p>

<p>The only other person beside the old woman
Finola ever saw was a dumb Dwarf who, mounted
on a broken-down horse, came once a month to
the hut, bringing with him a sack of corn for the
old woman and Finola. Although he couldn&#8217;t
speak to her, Finola was always glad to see the
Dwarf and his old horse, and she used to give
them cake made with her own white hands. As
for the Dwarf he would have died for the little
Princess, he was so much in love with her, and
often and often his heart was heavy and sad as
he thought of her pining away in the lonely
moor.</p>

<p>It chanced that he came one day, and she did
not, as usual, come out to greet him. He made
signs to the old woman, but she took up a stick
and struck him, and beat his horse and drove him
away; but as he was leaving he caught a glimpse
of Finola at the door of the hut, and saw that
she was crying. This sight made him so very
miserable that he could think of nothing else but
her sad face, that he had always seen so bright;
and he allowed the old horse to go on without
minding where he was going. Suddenly he heard
a voice saying: &ldquo;It is time for you to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dwarf looked, and right before him, at the
foot of a green hill, was a little man not half as
big as himself, dressed in a green jacket with
brass buttons, and a red cap and tassel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time for you to come,&rdquo; he said the second
time; &ldquo;but you are welcome, anyhow. Get off
your horse and come in with me, that I may
touch your lips with the wand of speech, that
we may have a talk together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dwarf got off his horse and followed the
little man through a hole in the side of a green
hill. The hole was so small that he had to go on
his hands and knees to pass through it, and when
he was able to stand he was only the same height
as the little Fairyman. After walking three or
four steps they were in a splendid room, as bright
as day. Diamonds sparkled in the roof as stars
sparkle in the sky when the night is without a
cloud. The roof rested on golden pillars, and
between the pillars were silver lamps, but their
light was dimmed by that of the diamonds. In the
middle of the room was a table, on which were
two golden plates and two silver knives and
forks, and a brass bell as big as a hazelnut, and
beside the table were two little chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a chair,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;and I will
ring for the wand of speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dwarf sat down, and the Fairyman rang
the little brass bell, and in came a little weeny
Dwarf no bigger than your hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me the wand of speech,&rdquo; said the
Fairy, and the weeny Dwarf bowed three times
and walked out backward, and in a minute he
returned, carrying a little black wand with a red
berry at the top of it, and, giving it to the Fairy,
he bowed three times and walked out backward
as he had done before.</p>

<p>The little man waved the rod three times over
the Dwarf, and struck him once on the right
shoulder and once on the left shoulder, and then
touched his lips with the red berry, and said:
&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dwarf spoke, and he was so rejoiced at
hearing the sound of his own voice that he
danced about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you at all, at all?&rdquo; said he to the
Fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is yourself?&rdquo; said the Fairy. &ldquo;But
come, before we have any talk let us have something
to eat, for I am sure you are hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they sat down to table, and the Fairy
rang the little brass bell twice, and the weeny
Dwarf brought in two boiled snails in their
shells, and when they had eaten the snails he
brought in a dormouse, and when they had eaten
the dormouse he brought in two wrens, and when
they had eaten the wrens he brought in two nuts
full of wine, and they became very merry, and
the Fairyman sang &ldquo;Cooleen Dhas,&rdquo; and the
Dwarf sang &ldquo;The Little Blackbird of the Glen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the &lsquo;Foggy Dew&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the
Fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&#8217;ll give it to you; but we must
have some more wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the wine was brought, and he sang the
&ldquo;Foggy Dew,&rdquo; and the Dwarf said it was the
sweetest song he had ever heard, and that the
Fairyman&#8217;s voice would coax the birds off the
bushes!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked me who I am?&rdquo; said the Fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I asked you who is yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; said
the Dwarf, and he blushed like a rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me what you know about yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>&ldquo;I remember nothing at all,&rdquo; said the Dwarf,
&ldquo;before the day I found myself going along with
a crowd of all sorts of people to the great fair of
the Liffey. We had to pass by the King&#8217;s palace
on our way, and as we were passing the King sent
for a band of jugglers to come and show their
tricks before him. I followed the jugglers to
look on, and when the play was over the King
called me to him, and asked me who I was and
where I came from. I was dumb then, and
couldn&#8217;t answer; but even if I could speak I
could not tell him what he wanted to know, for
I remembered nothing of myself before that day.
Then the King asked the jugglers, but they
knew nothing about me, and no one knew anything,
and then the King said he would take me
into his service; and the only work I have to
do is to go once a month with a bag of corn
to the hut in the lonely moor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there you fell in love with the little
Princess,&rdquo; said the Fairy, winking at the Dwarf.</p>

<p>The poor Dwarf blushed twice as much as he
had done before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not blush,&rdquo; said the Fairy; &ldquo;it is a
good man&#8217;s case. And now tell me, truly, do you
love the Princess, and what would you give to
free her from the spell of enchantment that is
over her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give my life,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, listen to me,&rdquo; said the Fairy.
&ldquo;The Princess Finola was banished to the lonely
moor by the King, your master. He killed her
father, who was the rightful King, and would
have killed Finola, only he was told by an old
sorceress that if he killed her he would die himself
on the same day, and she advised him to
banish her to the lonely moor, and she said she
would fling a spell of enchantment over it, and
that until the spell was broken Finola could not
leave the moor. And the sorceress also promised
that she would send an old woman to watch
over the Princess by night and by day, so that no
harm should come to her; but she told the King
that he himself should select a messenger to take
food to the hut, and that he should look out for
someone who had never seen or heard of the
Princess, and whom he could trust never to tell
anyone anything about her; and that is the reason
he selected you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you know so much,&rdquo; said the Dwarf,
&ldquo;can you tell me who I am, and where I came
from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know that time enough,&rdquo; said the
Fairy. &ldquo;I have given you back your speech. It
will depend solely on yourself whether you will
get back your memory of who and what you were
before the day you entered the King&#8217;s service.
But are you really willing to try and break the
spell of enchantment and free the Princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever it will cost you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it cost me my life,&rdquo; said the Dwarf;
&ldquo;but tell me, how can the spell be broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is easy enough to break the spell if
you have the weapons,&rdquo; said the Fairy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are they, and where are they?&rdquo;
said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spear of the shining haft and the dark
blue blade and the silver shield,&rdquo; said the Fairy.
&ldquo;They are on the farther bank of the Mystic
Lake in the Island of the Western Seas. They
are there for the man who is bold enough to seek
them. If you are the man who will bring them
back to the lonely moor you will only have to
strike the shield three times with the haft, and
three times with the blade of the spear, and the
silence of the moor will be broken forever, the
spell of enchantment will be removed, and the
Princess will be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will set out at once,&rdquo; said the Dwarf,
jumping from his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whatever it cost you,&rdquo; said the Fairy,
&ldquo;will you pay the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, mount your horse, give him his
head, and he will take you to the shore opposite
the Island of the Mystic Lake. You must cross
to the island on his back, and make your way
through the water-steeds that swim around the
island night and day to guard it; but woe betide
you if you attempt to cross without paying the
price, for if you do the angry water-steeds will
rend you and your horse to pieces. And when
you come to the Mystic Lake you must wait until
the waters are as red as wine, and then swim
your horse across it, and on the farther side you
will find the spear and shield; but woe betide
you if you attempt to cross the lake before you
pay the price, for if you do, the black Cormorants
of the Western Seas will pick the flesh from your
bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price?&rdquo; said the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know that time enough,&rdquo; said the
Fairy; &ldquo;but now go, and good luck go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dwarf thanked the Fairy, and said good-by.
He then threw the reins on his horse&#8217;s
neck, and started up the hill, that seemed to grow
bigger and bigger as he ascended, and the Dwarf
soon found that what he took for a hill was a
great mountain. After traveling all the day, toiling
up by steep crags and heathery passes, he
reached the top as the sun was setting in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
ocean, and he saw far below him out in the
waters the island of the Mystic Lake.</p>

<p>He began his descent to the shore, but long
before he reached it the sun had set, and darkness,
unpierced by a single star, dropped upon
the sea. The old horse, worn out by his long and
painful journey, sank beneath him, and the
Dwarf was so tired that he rolled off his back
and fell asleep by his side.</p>

<p>He awoke at the breaking of the morning, and
saw that he was almost at the water&#8217;s edge. He
looked out to sea, and saw the island, but nowhere
could he see the water-steeds, and he began
to fear he must have taken a wrong course
in the night, and that the island before him was
not the one he was in search of. But even while
he was so thinking he heard fierce and angry
snortings, and, coming swiftly from the island
to the shore, he saw the swimming and prancing
steeds. Sometimes their heads and manes only
were visible, and sometimes, rearing, they rose
half out of the water, and, striking it with their
hoofs, churned it into foam, and tossed the white
spray to the skies. As they approached nearer
and nearer their snortings became more terrible,
and their nostrils shot forth clouds of vapor.
The Dwarf trembled at the sight and sound, and
his old horse, quivering in every limb, moaned
piteously, as if in pain. On came the steeds,
until they almost touched the shore, then rearing,
they seemed about to spring on to it.</p>

<p>The frightened Dwarf turned his head to fly,
and as he did so he heard the twang of a golden
harp, and right before him whom should he see
but the little man of the hills, holding a harp in
one hand and striking the strings with the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to pay the price?&rdquo; said he,
nodding gayly to the Dwarf.</p>

<p>As he asked the question, the listening water-steeds
snorted more furiously than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to pay the price?&rdquo; said the
little man a second time.</p>

<p>A shower of spray, tossed on shore by the
angry steeds, drenched the Dwarf to the skin,
and sent a cold shiver to his bones, and he was
so terrified that he could not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the third and last time, are you ready to
pay the price?&rdquo; asked the Fairy, as he flung the
harp behind him and turned to depart.</p>

<p>When the Dwarf saw him going he thought of
the little Princess in the lonely moor, and his
courage came back, and he answered bravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The water-steeds, hearing his answer, and
snorting with rage, struck the shore with their
pounding hoofs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back to your waves!&rdquo; cried the little harper;
and as he ran his fingers across his lyre, the
frightened steeds drew back into the waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price?&rdquo; asked the Dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your right eye,&rdquo; said the Fairy; and before
the Dwarf could say a word, the Fairy scooped
out the eye with his finger, and put it into his
pocket.</p>

<p>The Dwarf suffered most terrible agony; but
he resolved to bear it for the sake of the little
Princess. Then the Fairy sat down on a rock at
the edge of the sea, and, after striking a few
notes, he began to play the &ldquo;Strains of Slumber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound crept along the waters, and the
steeds, so ferocious a moment before, became perfectly
still. They had no longer any motion of
their own, and they floated on the top of the tide
like foam before a breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Fairy, as he led the Dwarf&#8217;s
horse to the edge of the tide.</p>

<p>The Dwarf urged the horse into the water, and
once out of his depth, the old horse struck out
boldly for the island. The sleeping water-steeds
drifted helplessly against him, and in a short
time he reached the island safely, and he neighed
joyously as his hoofs touched solid ground.</p>

<p>The Dwarf rode on and on, until he came to a
bridle-path, and following this, it led him up
through winding lanes, bordered with golden
furze that filled the air with fragrance, and
brought him to the summit of the green hills that
girdled and looked down on the Mystic Lake.
Here the horse stopped of his own accord, and
the Dwarf&#8217;s heart beat quickly as his eye rested
on the lake, that, clipped round by the ring of
hills, seemed in the breezeless and sunlit air&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;As still as death.</span><br />
And as bright as life can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After gazing at it for a long time, he dismounted,
and lay at his ease in the pleasant grass.
Hour after hour passed, but no change came
over the face of the waters; and when the night
fell, sleep closed the eyelids of the Dwarf.</p>

<p>The song of the lark awoke him in the early
morning, and, starting up, he looked at the lake,
but its waters were as bright as they had been
the day before.</p>

<p>Toward midday he beheld what he thought was
a black cloud sailing across the sky from east
to west. It seemed to grow larger as it came
nearer and nearer, and when it was high above
the lake he saw it was a huge bird, the shadow
of whose outstretched wings darkened the waters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the lake; and the Dwarf knew it was one
of the Cormorants of the Western Seas. As it
descended slowly, he saw that it held in one of
its claws a branch of a tree larger than a full-grown
oak, and laden with clusters of ripe red
berries. It alighted at some distance from the
Dwarf, and, after resting for a time, it began
to eat the berries and to throw the stones into
the lake, and wherever a stone fell a bright red
stain appeared in the water. As he looked more
closely at the bird the Dwarf saw that it had all
the signs of old age, and he could not help wondering
how it was able to carry such a heavy
tree.</p>

<p>Later in the day, two other birds, as large as
the first, but younger, came up from the west and
settled down beside him. They also ate the berries,
and throwing the stones into the lake it was
soon as red as wine.</p>

<p>When they had eaten all the berries, the young
birds began to pick the decayed feathers off the
old bird and to smooth his plumage. As soon as
they had completed their task, he rose slowly
from the hill and sailed out over the lake, and
dropping down on the waters dived beneath them.
In a moment he came to the surface, and shot
up into the air with a joyous cry, and flew off to
the west in all the vigor of renewed youth, followed
by the other birds.</p>

<p>When they had gone so far that they were like
specks in the sky, the Dwarf mounted his horse
and descended toward the lake.</p>

<p>He was almost at the margin, and in another
minute would have plunged in, when he heard a
fierce screaming in the air, and before he had
time to look up, the three birds were hovering
over the lake.</p>

<p>The Dwarf drew back frightened.</p>

<p>The birds wheeled over his head, and then,
swooping down, they flew close to the water,
covering it with their wings, and uttering harsh
cries.</p>

<p>Then, rising to a great height, they folded their
wings and dropped headlong, like three rocks, on
the lake, crashing its surface, and scattering a
wine-red shower upon the hills.</p>

<p>Then the Dwarf remembered what the Fairy
told him, that if he attempted to swim the lake,
without paying the price, the three Cormorants
of the Western Seas would pick the flesh off his
bones. He knew not what to do, and was about
to turn away, when he heard once more the twang
of the golden harp, and the little fairy of the hills
stood before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faint heart never won fair lady,&rdquo; said the
little harper. &ldquo;Are you ready to pay the price?
The spear and shield are on the opposite bank,
and the Princess Finola is crying this moment
in the lonely moor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of Finola&#8217;s name the Dwarf&#8217;s
heart grew strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am ready&mdash;win or die. What
is the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your left eye,&rdquo; said the Fairy. And as soon
as said he scooped out the eye, and put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p>The poor blind Dwarf almost fainted with
pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s your last trial,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;and now
do what I tell you. Twist your horse&#8217;s mane
round your right hand, and I will lead him to
the water. Plunge in, and fear not. I gave you
back your speech. When you reach the opposite
bank you will get back your memory, and you
will know who and what you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Fairy led the horse to the margin
of the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In with you now, and good luck go with
you,&rdquo; said the Fairy.</p>

<p>The Dwarf urged the horse. He plunged into
the lake, and went down and down until his feet
struck the bottom. Then he began to ascend,
and as he came near the surface of the water the
Dwarf thought he saw a glimmering light, and
when he rose above the water he saw the bright
sun shining and the green hills before him, and
he shouted with joy at finding his sight restored.</p>

<p>But he saw more. Instead of the old horse he
had ridden into the lake he was bestride a noble
steed, and as the steed swam to the bank the
Dwarf felt a change coming over himself, and an
unknown vigor in his limbs.</p>

<p>When the steed touched the shore he galloped
up the hillside, and on the top of the hill was a
silver shield, bright as the sun, resting against
a spear standing upright in the ground.</p>

<p>The Dwarf jumped off, and, running toward
the shield, he saw himself as in a looking-glass.</p>

<p>He was no longer a dwarf, but a gallant knight.
At that moment his memory came back to him,
and he knew he was Conal, one of the Knights
of the Red Branch, and he remembered now that
the spell of dumbness and deformity had been
cast upon him by the Witch of the Palace of the
Quicken Trees.</p>

<p>Slinging his shield upon his left arm, he
plucked the spear from the ground and leaped on
to his horse. With a light heart he swam back
over the lake, and nowhere could he see the black
Cormorants of the Western Seas, but three white
swans floating abreast followed him to the bank.
When he reached the bank he galloped down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the sea, and crossed to the shore.</p>

<p>Then he flung the reins upon his horse&#8217;s neck,
and swifter than the wind the gallant horse
swept on and on, and it was not long until he was
bounding over the enchanted moor. Wherever
his hoofs struck the ground, grass and flowers
sprang up, and great trees with leafy branches
rose on every side.</p>

<p>At last the knight reached the little hut. Three
times he struck the shield with the haft and three
times with the blade of his spear. At the last
blow the hut disappeared, and standing before
him was the little Princess.</p>

<p>The knight took her in his arms and kissed
her; then he lifted her on to the horse, and, leaping
up before her, he turned toward the north,
to the palace of the Red Branch Knights; and
as they rode on beneath the leafy trees, from
every tree the birds sang out, for the spell of
deathly silence over the lonely moor was broken
forever.</p></div>

<h2><a name="OX" id="OX"></a>THE STRAW OX</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Russian Tale</em></p>


<p>An old man and an old woman lived in an old
house on the edge of the forest. The old man
worked in the field all day and the woman spun
flax. But for all of their hard work they were
very poor&mdash;never one penny could they save. One
day the old man said to the old woman:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to give you something to please
you, but I have nothing to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;make
me a straw ox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A straw ox!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;What will
you do with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>So the old man made a straw ox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smear it all over with tar,&rdquo; said the old
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I smear it with tar?&rdquo; asked the
old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>So the old man smeared the straw ox all over
with tar.</p>

<p>The next morning when the old woman went
out into the field to gather flax she took the straw
ox with her and left it standing alone near the
edge of the forest.</p>

<p>A bear came out of the woods, and said to the
ox: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;I am an ox all smeared with tar,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .2em;">And filled with straw, as oxen are,&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>replied the ox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;I need some straw to
mend my coat, and the tar will keep it in place.
Give me some straw and some tar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; said the ox.</p>

<p>So the bear began to tear at the ox, and his
great paws stuck fast, and he pulled and he
tugged, and he tugged and he pulled, and the
more he pulled and tugged, the faster he stuck,
and he could not get away.</p>

<p>Then the ox dragged the bear to the old house
on the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>When the old woman came back with her apron
full of flax and saw that the straw ox had gone
she ran home as fast as she could. There stood
the ox with the bear stuck fast to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband, husband! Come here at once,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;The ox has brought home a bear; what
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man came as fast as he could, pulled
the bear off the ox, tied him up, and threw him
into the cellar.</p>

<p>The next morning when the old woman went
into the field to gather flax she again took the
straw ox with her, and again she left him standing
alone near the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>A wolf came out of the woods, and said to the
ox: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;I am an ox all smeared with tar,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .2em;">And filled with straw, as oxen are,&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>replied the ox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;I need some tar to smear
my coat so that the dogs cannot catch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; said the ox.</p>

<p>The wolf put up his paws to take the tar and
his paws stuck fast. He pulled and he tugged,
and he tugged and he pulled, and the more he
pulled and tugged, the faster he stuck and he
could not get away.</p>

<p>Then the ox dragged the wolf to the old house
on the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>When the old woman came back with her apron
full of flax and saw that the straw ox had gone
she ran home as fast as she could. There stood the
ox in the yard with the wolf stuck fast to him.</p>

<p>A fox came out of the woods, and said to the ox:
&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;I am an ox all smeared with tar,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .2em;">And filled with straw, as oxen are,&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The fox put up his paws to take the tar, and
his paws stuck fast. He pulled and he tugged,
and he tugged and he pulled, and the more he
pulled and tugged, the faster he stuck, and he
could not get away.</p>

<p>Then the ox dragged the fox to the old house
on the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>When the old woman came back with her apron
full of flax and saw that the straw ox had gone
she ran home as fast as she could. There stood the
ox with the fox stuck fast to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband, husband! Come here at once!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;The ox has brought home a fox; what
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man came as fast as he could, pulled
the fox off the ox, tied him up, and threw him
into the cellar.</p>

<p>The next morning when the woman came back
with her apron full of flax and saw that the ox
had gone and she had run home as fast as she
could, there stood the ox with a rabbit stuck fast
to him.</p>

<p>And the old man threw the rabbit into the
cellar.</p>

<p>The next morning the old man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we will see what will come of all of
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took his knife and sat down by the cellar
door and began to make the knife sharp and
bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, old man?&rdquo; asked the
bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making my knife sharp and bright so as
to cut up your coat and make a nice warm jacket
for the old woman to keep her warm this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;Do not cut up my coat.
Let me go, and I will bring you some nice, sweet
honey to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;see to it that
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man let the bear go.</p>

<p>Then he sat down again and began to make
his knife sharp and bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, old man?&rdquo; asked the
wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making my knife sharp and bright so as
to cut up your coat to make me a fine fur cap,&rdquo;
said the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;Do not cut up my coat.
Let me go and I will bring you some sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;see to it that
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man let the wolf go.</p>

<p>Then he sat down again with his knife in his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, old man?&rdquo; asked the
fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making my knife sharp and bright so as
to cut up your coat to make me a nice fur collar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the fox, &ldquo;do not cut up my coat.
Let me go and I will bring you some geese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;see to it that
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in the same way he let the rabbit loose,
who said that he would bring some cabbage and
some turnips and some carrots.</p>

<p>The next morning early the old woman woke
up and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one is knocking at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old man got up and went to the door
and opened it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the bear, &ldquo;I have brought you a
jar full of honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man, and he gave
the jar to the old woman who put it on the
shelf.</p>

<p>Then came the wolf driving a flock of sheep
into the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;I have brought you a
flock of sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the old man, and he drove
the sheep into the pasture.</p>

<p>Then came the fox, with many geese running
before him, and the old man drove them into
the pen; and then came the rabbit with cabbages
and turnips and carrots and other good things,
and the old woman took them and put them into
the pot and cooked them.</p>

<p>And the old man said to the old woman, &ldquo;Now
we have sheep in the pasture and many geese
in the pen, and we are rich, and I can give you
something to please you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY B. J. DASKAM</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time the
great, yellow stork
carried a baby Princess
to the Queen of
that country which
lies next to fairy-land.</p>

<p>All throughout the kingdom the bells rang,
the people shouted, and the King declared a holiday
for a whole year. But the Queen was very
anxious, for she knew that the fairies are a
queer lot, and their borders were very close indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be very careful to slight none of
them at the christening,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for goodness
knows what they might do, if we did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the wise-men drew up the lists, and when
the day for the christening arrived, the fairies
were all there, and everything went as smoothly
as a frosted cake.</p>

<p>But the Queen said to the Lady-in-waiting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first fairy godmother gave her nothing
but a kiss! I don&#8217;t call that much of a gift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8217;Sh!&rdquo; whispered the Lady-in-waiting. &ldquo;The
fairies hear everything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And indeed, the fairy heard her well enough,
and very angry she was about it, too. For she
was so old that she knew all about it, from beginning
to end, and she was sure that the Wizard
with Three Dragons was sitting in the Black
Forest, watching the whole matter in his crystal
globe. So she had whispered her gift&mdash;which
was nothing more nor less than a Fearless Heart&mdash;into
the ear of the Little Princess. But the
Queen thought she had only kissed her.</p>

<p>So, when the clock was on the hour of four
(which, as every one knows, is the end of
christenings and fairy gifts) the first godmother
went up to the golden cradle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my first gift was not satisfactory to
every one,&rdquo; she said, angrily, &ldquo;I will give the
Little Princess another. And that is, that when
the time comes she shall marry the Prince of the
Black Heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the clock struck four, while the Queen
wept on the bosom of the Lady-in-waiting.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the christening.</p>

<p>Then the King called the wise-men together,
and for forty days and nights they read the
books and studied the stars.</p>

<p>In the end, they laid out a Garden, with a wall
so high that the sun could not shine over it until
noon, and so broad that it was a day&#8217;s journey
for a swift horse to cross it. One tiny door there
was: but the first gate was of iron, and five-and-twenty
men-at-arms stood before it, day and
night, with drawn swords; the second gate was
of beaten copper, and before that were fifty archers,
with arrows on the string; the third gate
was of triple brass, and before it a hundred
knights, in full armor, rode without ceasing.</p>

<p>Into the Garden went the Little Princess, and
the Queen, and all her ladies; but no man might
pass the gates, save the King himself. And there
the Princess dwelt until her seventeenth birthday,
without seeing any more of the world than
the inside of the wall.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, some time before, a
young Prince had ridden out of the west and set
about his travels. For the wise-man on the hill
had come to him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the kingdom which lies next to fairyland
dwells a Little Princess who has a Fearless
Heart. There is a wall which will not be easy
to climb, but the Princess is more beautiful than
anything else in the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was enough for the Prince, so he
girded on his sword, and set out, singing as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
went for pure lightness of heart.</p>

<p>But it is not so easy to find fairyland as it is
to eat a ripe apple, and the Prince could have
told you that, before he was through. For in
some places it is so broad that it takes in the
whole world, and in others so narrow that a flea
could cross it in two jumps. So that some people
never leave it all their lives long, but others cross
at a single step, and never see it at all.</p>

<p>Finally, the Prince came to the place where all
roads meet, and they were as much alike as the
hairs on a dog&#8217;s back. But it was all one to him,
so he rode straight ahead and lost himself in
fairyland.</p>

<p>When the first fairy godmother saw him, she
laughed to herself and flew away, straight over
his head, to the wall around the Garden. But
you may be sure that she did not trouble the
guards at the triple gates: for, if one has wings,
what is the use of stairs? So over the wall she
flew to the room where the Little Princess lay
sleeping.</p>

<p>You may readily believe that the Princess was
astonished when she awoke to find the fairy
beside her bed, but she was not in the least
alarmed, for, you see, she did not know that there
was anything in the world to be afraid of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;I am your first
fairy godmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Godmother?&rdquo; said the
Princess, and she sat up in bed and courtesied.
Which is a very difficult trick, indeed, and it is
not every Princess who can do it.</p>

<p>Her godmother was so delighted that she
leaned over and kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the second time I have kissed you,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;When I go, I will kiss you again, and
you had better save the three of them, for they
will be useful when you go out into the world.
And, my dear, it is high time that you were
going out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Little Princess was overjoyed, but
she only nodded her head wisely and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, the world is as big as the whole Garden,
and wider than the wall. But I can never
go out, for the gates are always locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not go now,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;you
will have to go later, and that might not be so
well. And you should not argue with me, for I
am older than you will ever be, and your godmother,
besides. Now kiss me, for I must be going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she flew away, about her other affairs, for
she was a very busy old lady indeed.</p>

<p>In the morning the Princess went to breakfast
with the King and the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is high time that I
went out into the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen was so startled that she dropped
her egg on the floor and the King was red as a
beet with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What nonsense is
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fairy godmother was here last night,&rdquo;
said the Princess, &ldquo;and she told me all about it.
I will go this morning, please, if I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; roared the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do no such thing!&rdquo; wailed the
Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There could have been no one here,&rdquo; said the
King, &ldquo;for the gates were all locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you that you had a fairy godmother?&rdquo;
asked the Queen.</p>

<p>And there was an end of that.</p>

<p>But that night, after the Princess had said her
prayers and crept into bed, she heard her godmother
calling to her from the Garden, so she
slipped on her cloak and stole out into the moonlight.
There was no one to be seen, so she pattered
along in her little bare feet until she came
to the gate in the wall.</p>

<p>While she was hesitating whether or not to
run back to her little white bed, the gates of
triple brass opened as easily as if her godmother
had oiled them, and the Little Princess passed
through the copper gates, and the iron gate, and
out into fairyland.</p>

<p>But if you ask me why she saw the guards at
the gates no more than they saw her, I can only
tell you that I do not know, and you will have
to be satisfied with that.</p>

<p>As for the Princess, she was as happy as a
duck in a puddle. As she danced along through
the forests, the flowers broke from their stems
to join her, the trees dropped golden fruit into
her very hands, and the little brook which runs
through fairyland left its course, and followed
her, singing.</p>

<p>And all the while, her godmother was coming
down behind her, close at hand, to see that she
came to no harm; but the Princess did not
know that.</p>

<p>At last she came to the place where the Prince
from the west lay sleeping. He was dreaming
that he had climbed the wall and had found the
Princess, so that he smiled in his sleep and she
knelt above him, wondering, for she had never
seen a man before, save her father, the King,
and the Prince was very fair. So she bent closer
and closer, until her breath was on his cheek,
and as he opened his eyes, she kissed him.</p>

<p>As for the Prince, he thought that he was
still asleep, till he saw that she was many times
more beautiful than in his dreams, and he knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that he had found her at last.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/img123.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the princess and the fairy</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are more beautiful than anything else in
the world,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I love you better than
my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I love you with all my heart!&rdquo; said the
Little Princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me,&rdquo; asked the Prince, &ldquo;and
live with me forever and ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;and gladly,
if my father, the King, and my mother, the
Queen, will let me leave the Garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she told the Prince all about the wall with
the triple gates.</p>

<p>The Prince saw that it would be no easy task
to win the consent of the King and the Queen,
so nothing would do but that he must travel back
to the west and return with a proper retinue behind
him.</p>

<p>So he bade the Princess good-by and rode
bravely off toward the west.</p>

<p>The Princess went slowly back through fairyland,
till she came to the wall, just as the sun
was breaking in the east. As every one knows,
White Magic is not of very much use in the daytime,
outside of fairyland, and if you ask why
this is not so at christenings, I will send you to
Peter Knowall, who keeps the Big Red Book.</p>

<p>So the guards at the triple gates saw the Princess,
and they raised such a hub-bub, that the
King and the Queen rushed out to see what all
the noise was about. You can easily believe that
they were in a great way when they saw the Little
Princess, who they thought was safe asleep
in her bed.</p>

<p>They lost no time in bundling her through the
gates, and then they fell to kissing her, and scolding
her, and shaking her, and hugging her, all in
the same breath.</p>

<p>But the Princess said, &ldquo;I have been out into
the world, and I am going to marry the Prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then perhaps there was not a great to-do
about the Garden!</p>

<p>They bullied and coaxed and scolded and wept,
but the Princess only said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love him with all my heart and when the
time comes I will go to him, if I have to beg my
way from door to door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the King flew into a towering rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;But when you
go, you may stay forever! I will cut your name
off the records, and any one who speaks it will
be beheaded, if it is the High Lord Chancellor,
himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was the turn of the Princess to weep,
for she loved her parents dearly, but she could
not promise to forget the Prince.</p>

<p>So matters went from pence to ha&#8217;pennies, as
the saying goes, till finally the Princess could
bear it no longer, so she found her cloak and
stole down to the triple gates.</p>

<p>Everything went very much as it had before,
save that there was no Prince asleep under the
tree where she had first found him. Then the
Princess would have turned back, but the little
brook which followed at her heel had swollen
out into a broad, deep river, and there was nothing
to do but go ahead, till she came to a cottage
among the trees, and before the door sat an old,
old woman, spinning gold thread out of moonlight.
And by that any one could have told that
she was a fairy, but the Princess thought it was
always done that way in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how shall I find my
way out of the forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the old woman went on spinning, and the
Princess thought that she had never seen anything
fly so fast as the shuttle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you wanting to go?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am searching for the Prince from the west,&rdquo;
said the Princess sadly. &ldquo;Can you tell me where
to find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fairy shook her head and went on with
her spinning, so fast that you could not see the
shuttle at all.</p>

<p>But the Princess begged so prettily that finally
she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were looking for a Prince, I would follow
my nose until I came to the Black Forest,
and then I would ask the Wizard with Three
Dragons, who knows all about it, and more, too!
That is, unless I thought that I would be afraid
in the Black Forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is afraid?&rdquo; asked the Little Princess.
&ldquo;I do not know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And no more she did, so the fairy laughed, for
she saw trouble coming for the Wizard. She
stopped her wheel with a click, but for all her
fast spinning, there was only enough gold thread
to go around the second finger of the Princess&#8217;s
left hand.</p>

<p>As for the Princess, she thanked the old lady
very kindly, and set bravely off toward the Black
Forest.</p>

<p>But the Wizard with Three Dragons only
laughed as he gazed into his crystal globe, for in
it he could see everything that was happening in
any place in the world, and I do not need Jacob
Wise-man to tell me that a globe like that is
worth having!</p>

<p>Now, when the Prince had left the Princess in
fairyland, he lost no time in riding back to the
west. The old King, his father, was overjoyed
when he heard of the Little Princess, and he
gave the Prince a retinue that stretched for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
mile behind him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">the wizard with the three dragons,<br />
and his crystal globe</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when they came to the place where all
roads meet, the Prince was greatly perplexed,
for this time, you see, he knew where he wanted
to go. In the end, he trusted to chance and rode
ahead, but they had not gone far before they
came to the castle of the Wizard with Three
Dragons, in the middle of the Black Forest.</p>

<p>In the great hall sat the Wizard, himself, waiting
for them, and he was as soft as butter.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, he knew the Princess well enough,
but it was too late to go further that night. So
the Prince and all his train had best come into
the castle and wait till morning.</p>

<p>That was what the Wizard said, and the
Prince was glad enough to listen to him, for he
was beginning to fear that he would never find
the Princess again. But hardly had the last
bowman come within the doors than the Wizard
blew upon his crystal globe, and muttered a spell.</p>

<p>At that, the Prince and his entire train were
changed to solid stone, in the twinkling of an
eye, and there they remained till, at the proper
time, the Little Princess of the Fearless Heart
came up the great stone steps of the castle.</p>

<p>The Wizard was sitting on his throne with his
Dragons behind his shoulder, staring into his
crystal globe as it spun in the air, hanging on
nothing at all.</p>

<p>He never took his eyes away when the Princess
came up to the throne, and she was far too
polite to interrupt him when he was so busy. So
for a long, long time she stood there waiting, and
the Wizard chuckled to himself, for he thought
that she was too frightened to speak. So he
breathed upon his crystal globe and muttered a
spell.</p>

<p>But of course, nothing happened, for the Little
Princess had a Fearless Heart!</p>

<p>Then the Wizard grew black as night, for he
saw that the matter was not so easy as plucking
wild flowers, so he turned away from the crystal
globe and stared at the Princess. His eyes
burned like two hot coals, so that she drew her
cloak closer about her, but you cannot hide your
heart from a Wizard with Three Dragons, unless
your cloak is woven of sunlight, and the
Little Black Dwarf has the only one of those in
the whole world, stowed away in an old chest
in the garret.</p>

<p>So the Wizard saw at once that the Little
Princess had a Fearless Heart, and his voice was
soft as rain-water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Little Princess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What is it
that you want of me in the Black Forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am looking for the Prince from the west,&rdquo;
said the Princess, eagerly. &ldquo;Can you tell me
where to find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Wizard. &ldquo;I can tell you that,
and perhaps some other things, besides. But
what will you give me for my trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Little Princess hung her head, for
she had nothing about her that was worth so
much as a bone button, and the Wizard knew
that as well as you and I. So he said, very
softly, &ldquo;Will you give me your Fearless Heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there was the whole matter in a nutshell!</p>

<p>But the Princess stamped her foot on the stone
floor. &ldquo;Of course I will not give you my heart,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And if you will not tell me for kindness,
I will be going on, for I have nothing with
which to pay you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; cried the Wizard&mdash;for he was
as wise as a rat in a library&mdash;&ldquo;If you will not
give me your heart, just let me have a kiss and I
will call it a bargain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Princess remembered her godmother&#8217;s
three kisses, and she thought that this
was the place for them, if they were ever to be
used at all, although she liked the thought of kissing
the Wizard about as much as she liked sour
wine. She crept up to the throne, and, with her
eyes tight closed, gave the Wizard the first of
the three kisses.</p>

<p>At that the whole Black Forest shook with the
force of the Magic, hissing through the trees,
and the Wizard, with his Three Dragons turned
into solid stone!</p>

<p>The crystal globe spun around in the air, humming
like a hive full of bees and sank slowly to
the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>Hardly had it touched the ground than the
whole castle rent and split into a thousand
pieces, and I would not like to have been there,
unless I had a bit of gold thread spun out of
moonlight around my finger, for the huge rocks
were falling as thick as peas in a pan!</p>

<p>But the Princess hardly noticed the rocks at
all, for, as the sun rose over the Black Forest,
she recognized the marble figure of the Prince,
standing among the ruins. You may be sure
that she was heartbroken as she went up to him,
weeping very bitterly and calling and calling on
his name. Then in her sorrow she reached up
and kissed the cold stone face with the second
magic kiss.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she felt the marble grow soft
and warm beneath her touch, and the Prince
came back to life and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>When he recognized the silent figures of his
gay train, he was sad as death, and the Princess
wept with him. But suddenly they saw an old, old
woman picking her way among the fallen stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Little Princess, &ldquo;that is the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
woman whom I met in the forest, spinning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the fairy laughed so hard that her hair
tumbled down about her feet, and it turned from
gray to silver, and silver to gold. The years fell
from her like a cloak, until she was more beautiful
than the thought of man could conceive!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I know you now!&rdquo; cried the Little Princess.
&ldquo;You are my first fairy godmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was the way of it, so she kissed them
both for pure joy. But when they asked her as
to which of the stone figures should have the
third magic kiss, she shook her head,</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of them at all!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But give me
back that bit of gold thread, for you will have no
further use for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she stretched the thread between her two
hands until it was so fine that you could not see
it at all, and laid it on the ground around the
Wizard and his Dragons, and tied a magic knot,
just behind the crystal globe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now give the third kiss to the crystal globe,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and see what will happen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Little Princess kissed the globe, and
from the place where her lips touched it, a
stream of water trickled down. As it touched
the feet of each statue, the marble softened to
flesh and blood, and the breath came back to it
until all of the Prince&#8217;s train were alive again;
but as for the Wizard, the water could not pass
the gold thread, so there he sits until this day&mdash;unless
some busybody has untied the magic knot.
Then the fairy flew away, singing a low, happy
song.</p>

<p>When the Prince and the Princess came to the
Garden, there was a wedding which lasted a
month, and then they rode off toward the west.</p>

<p>After they had gone, the Queen whispered to
the Lady-in-waiting,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see what careful parents can do! The
first fairy godmother was quite wrong about the
Prince of the Black Heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that very moment, the Prince had bared
his arm to pluck a water-flower, as they rested
beside the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that black mark on your arm?&rdquo; asked
the Princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Prince, laughing, &ldquo;that is just a
scar I have borne from birth. It is in the shape
of a heart, and so, for a jest, my people call me
the Prince of the Black Heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Heart, indeed!&rdquo; cried the Little Princess,
angrily.</p>

<p>And that is the end of the story, for if you
have no fear in your heart, black magic is no
such great thing after all.</p>

<p>But if any old fogy should wag his gray
beard and say there is not a word of truth in it,
you may be very sure that he came to fairyland
at the narrow place, and never saw it at all. So
you may just smile at him, for there is one thing,
at least, that you know more about than he does!</p>

<h2>MOPSA THE FAIRY</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD FROM JEAN INGELOW</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
&ldquo;<em>For he that hath his own world</em><br />
  <span style="margin-left: .2em;"><em>Hath many worlds more.</em>&rdquo;</span></p>


<p>A boy, whom I knew very well, was once going
through a meadow which was full of buttercups.
He sat down by an old hawthorn hedge
which was covered with blossoms, and took out
a slice of plum-cake for his lunch. While the
boy was eating, he observed that this hedge was
very high and thick, and that there was a great
hollow in the trunk of the old thorn-tree, and he
heard a twittering as if there was a nest somewhere
inside. So he thrust his head in, twisted
himself around, and looked up. After getting
used to the dim light in the hollow of the tree,
he saw, a good way above his head, a curious
nest. It was about three times as large as a
goldfinch&#8217;s. Just then he thought he heard some
little voices cry, &ldquo;Jack, Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get near,&rdquo; said the boy. So he began
to wriggle and twist himself up, and just as he
reached the top three heads which had been
peeking over the edge of the nest suddenly
popped down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those heads had no beaks, and the things have
no feathers,&rdquo; said Jack, as he stood on tip-toe
and poked in one of his fingers.</p>

<p>When he snatched one of them out of the nest,
it gave a loud squeak, and Jack was so frightened
that he lost his footing, dropped it, and
slipped down himself. Luckily, he was not hurt,
nor the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; either. It was creeping about
like an old baby, and had on a little frock and
pinafore.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE FAIRY BABY&#8217;S LUNCH</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a fairy!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, &ldquo;and this must
be a fairies&#8217; nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Fairy climbed up the side of the
hollow and scrambled again into her nest, and
Jack followed. Upon which all the nestlings
popped up their heads, and showing their pretty
white teeth pointed at the slice of cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a small piece, and I may not have anything
more to eat for a long time,&rdquo; said Jack;
&ldquo;but your mouths are very small, so you shall
each have a piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young fairies were a long time munching
the cake, and before they had finished it began
to be rather dark, because a thunder-storm was
coming up. The wind rose and made the old tree
rock, and creak, and tremble. The little Fairies
were so frightened that they got out of the nest
and crept into Jack&#8217;s pockets.</p>

<p>After the storm was over, Jack pulled one of
the Fairies out of his waistcoat pocket and said
to her: &ldquo;It is time for supper. Where are we
going to get it?&rdquo; Then in the light of the moon
he looked at her very attentively. &ldquo;When I first
saw you in the nest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you had a pinafore
on, and now you have a smart little apron
with lace around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because I am much older now,&rdquo; said
the Fairy. &ldquo;We never take such a long time to
grow up as you do. Put me into your pocket
again, and whistle as loudly as you can.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE GREAT WHITE BIRD</strong></p>

<p>So Jack whistled loudly; and suddenly without
hearing anything, he felt something take hold
of his legs and give him a jerk which hoisted
him on to its back, where he sat astride. It was a
large white bird, and presently he found that they
were rising up through the trees and out into
the moonlight, with Jack on the bird&#8217;s back and
all the fairies in his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so we are going to Fairy-land,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack; &ldquo;how delightful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the evening grew dark the great white
bird began to light up. She did it in this way.
First, one of her eyes began to beam with a
beautiful green light, and then when it was as
bright as a lamp, the other eye began to shine,
and the light of that eye was red. So they sailed
through the darkness, Jack reminding the bird
once in a while that he was very hungry.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>TO THE FAIR CITY</strong></p>

<p>They were sailing over the ocean by this time,
and there were boats and vessels. The great
white bird hovered among them, making choice
of one to take Jack and the Fairies up the wonderful
river which leads to Fairy-land. Finally
she set him down in a beautiful little open boat,
with a great carved figure-head to it. The bird
said: &ldquo;Lie down in the bottom of the boat and
go to sleep. You will dream that you have some
roast fowl, some new potatoes, and an apple
pie. Mind you, don&#8217;t eat too much in your dream,
or you will be sorry for it when you wake.&rdquo; Jack
put his arms around the neck of the bird and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
hugged her; then she spread her wings and
sailed slowly away. Then Jack fell asleep in the
rocking boat, and dreamed as the bird promised,
and when he woke up he was not hungry any
more!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/img129.jpg" width="365" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">it was a large white bird<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">from a drawing by harry rountree</span></span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morning came, and the Fairies were still asleep
in his pocket. The boat moved on through the
night, and now he found himself in the outlet
of the wonderful river, the shores of which
were guarded, not by real soldiers, but by rose-colored
flamingoes.</p>

<p>Now that he had fairies in his pockets, he
could understand bird talk, and so he heard many
wise words from the birds of that country which
guided him on his way.</p>

<p>It was not long before he came to the city that
was the capital. It was a fair day, and the city
square was full of white canopies, lined with
splendid flutings of pink. It was impossible to
be sure whether they were real tents, or gigantic
mushrooms. Each one of the people who sold
in these tents had a little high cap on his head
shaped just like a bee-hive made of straw. In
fact, Jack soon saw bees flying in and out, and it
was evident that these folks had their honey made
on the premises.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE LITTLE OLD FAIRY WOMAN</strong></p>

<p>After Jack had visited the fairy city, he went
back to the river. The water was so delightfully
clear that he thought he would have a
swim, so he took off his clothes and folded them
very carefully so as not to hurt the Fairies, and
laid them beside a hay-cock. When he came out
he saw a little old woman with spectacles on,
knitting beside his clothes. She smiled upon him
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you some breakfast out of my basket,&rdquo;
said she. So she took out a saucerful of
honey, a roll of bread, and a cup of milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but I am not a beggar
boy, so I can buy this breakfast. You look
very poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems that the old woman was very poor;
in fact, she was a slave, and on that very day
they were about to sell her in the slave market
in the city square. So Jack went along into
the city again with her, and when she was put
up for sale, he bought her from her cruel master,
although it took a half-crown, the biggest piece
of money that he had. His next largest piece he
gave to the little woman, and told her to buy some
clothes with it. She came back to the boat where
Jack was, with her hands empty, but her face
full of satisfaction.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE WONDERFUL PURPLE ROBE</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you have not bought any new clothes,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have bought what I wanted,&rdquo; said the Fairy
Woman; and she took out of her pocket a little
tiny piece of purple ribbon, with a gold-colored
satin edge, and a very small tortoise-shell comb.</p>

<p>She took the piece of ribbon and pulled and
pulled it until it was as large as a handkerchief.
Then she pulled and pulled it again, and the silk
stretched until it nearly filled the boat. Next,
the little old woman pulled off her ragged gown
and put on the silk. It was now a most beautiful
robe of purple, with a gold border, and
it just fitted her. Then she took out the little
tortoise-shell comb, pulled off her cap and threw
it into the river. As she combed her hair, it
grew much longer and thicker, until it fell in
waves all about her body. It all turned gold
color, and she was so covered with it that you
could not see one bit of her except her eyes,
which peeped out and were very bright.</p>

<p>Then she began to gather up her lovely locks
and said: &ldquo;Master, look at me now!&rdquo; So she
threw back the hair from her face, and it was
a beautiful young face, and she looked so happy
that Jack was glad he had bought her with his
half-crown.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE MAGIC KISS</strong></p>

<p>Then instantly the little Fairies awoke and
sprang out of Jack&#8217;s pockets. One of them had
a green velvet cap and sword; the second had
a white spangled robe, and lovely rubies and
emeralds around her neck; but the third one,
who sat down on Jack&#8217;s knee, had a white frock
and a blue sash, was very little, and she had a
face just like that of a sweet little child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How comes it that you are not like the
others?&rdquo; asked Jack. She answered: &ldquo;It is because
you kissed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; Jack explained to the former Fairy
Slave, &ldquo;she was my favorite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will have to let her sit on your
knee, master, sometimes,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;and
you must take special care of her, for she cannot
now take the same care of herself that others
can. The love of a mortal works changes indeed
to the life of a fairy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t want to have a slave,&rdquo; said Jack to the
little lady. &ldquo;Can&#8217;t you find some way to be wholly
free again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, master, I can be free if you can think
of anything that you really like better than the
half-crown that you paid for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like going up this river to Fairy-land
much better,&rdquo; said Jack. So suddenly the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
river became full of thousands of little people
coming down the stream in rafts. They had
come to take the Fairy Woman away with them.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE FAIRY WOMAN&#8217;S PARTING GIFT</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;What gift may I give you before I go?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;to have a little tiny
bit of that purple gown of yours with the gold
border.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she told Jack to lend her his knife, and
with it she cut off a very small piece of the skirt
of her robe and gave it to him. &ldquo;Now I advise
you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;never to stretch this unless you
want to make something particular out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye step aboard, my dearest?&rdquo; sang the
Fairy Woman as she sailed away.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.2em;">&ldquo;Will ye step aboard, my dearest? for the high seas lie before us.</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I sailed adown the river in those days without alloy.</span><br />
 We are launched! But when, I wonder, shall a sweeter sound float o&#8217;er us<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than yon &lsquo;pull&#8217;e haul&#8217;e, pull&#8217;e haul&#8217;e, yoy! heave, hoy!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>All Jack had to do to make his magic boat go
wherever he wished was to give it a command, so
he ordered it to float up the river to Fairy-land.</p>

<p>It was not long before the towers of the castle
of the Queen of Fairy-land could be seen in the
distance; and soon the castle, with its beautiful
gardens, was close beside them along the river
bank. But Jack did not dare to enter the castle
until he was sure of a shelter of his own. So
he pulled and pulled at the piece of purple silk,
until it became large enough to make a splendid
canopy like a tent. It roofed in all the after-part
of the boat, so now he had a delightful little home
of his own, and there was no fear of its being
blown away, for no wind ever blows in Fairy-land.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>TO THE PALACE</strong></p>

<p>When the Fairy Woman went back to her people
she took all of the fairy children with her,
and left only Mopsa with Jack. Now, Jack carefully
washed her face, and put a beautiful clean
white frock on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go into the Queen&#8217;s palace together,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>The Queen greeted Mopsa and Jack very
kindly; and every day they went up to the palace,
and every night back again to the tent on the
little boat.</p>

<p>One song which they liked to sing made Jack
rather uncomfortable:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.2em;">&ldquo;And all the knights shall woo again,</span><br />
 And all the doves shall coo again,<br />
 And all the dreams come true again,<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Jack shall go home.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Every evening Jack noticed that Mopsa was a
little taller, and had grown-up to a higher button
on his coat. She looked much wiser, too. &ldquo;You
must learn to read,&rdquo; said he; and as she made no
objection, he arranged daisies and buttercups into
the forms of the letters, and she learned nearly all
of them in one evening, while crowds of the
fairies from the castle looked on, hanging from
the boughs and shouting out the names of the
letters as Mopsa said them. They were very
polite to Jack, for they gathered up all the flowers
for him, and emptied them from their little caps at
his feet as fast as he wanted them.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>MOPSA IS TO BE A QUEEN</strong></p>

<p>Now it seems that as soon as Mopsa was full
grown she was destined to be Queen herself. One
day, just before dusk, she said to Jack: &ldquo;Jack,
will you give me your little purse that has the
silver fourpence in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this purse was lined with a nice piece of
pale green silk; and when Jack gave it to her,
she pulled the silk out and stretched it, just as the
fairy woman had done, and it became a most
lovely cloak. Then she twisted up her long hair
into a coil, fastened it around her head, and
called to the fireflies, which were beginning to
glitter on the trees; and they came and alighted
in a row upon the coil, and turned into diamonds
directly! So now Mopsa had a crown and a
robe. She was so beautiful that Jack thought he
would never be tired of looking at her.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack found that his fairy
boat had floated away. He called to it, but it
would not return. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mopsa,
&ldquo;my country is still waiting for me beyond the
purple mountains. I shall never be happy unless
we go there, and we can go together on foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they walked toward the purple mountains
hand-in-hand. When night came, and they were
too tired to walk any further, the shooting stars
began to appear in all directions; and at Mopsa&#8217;s
command they brought a little cushion, and Jack
and Mopsa sat upon it, and the stars carried the
two over the paths of the mountains and half-way
down the other side. When they awoke the next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
morning, there spread before them the loveliest
garden one ever saw, and among the trees and
woods was a most beautiful castle.</p>

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; said Mopsa, &ldquo;I am sure that castle
is the place I am to live in. I shall soon be Queen
and there I shall reign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall be King there,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Shall
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can,&rdquo; answered Mopsa; &ldquo;and in
Fairy-land, of course, whatever you can do, you
may do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a long way to the castle; and at last Jack
and Mopsa were so tired that they sat down, and
Mopsa began to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that you are nearly
a Queen, and you can never reach your castle by
sitting still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of a sudden they heard the sweetest sound
in the world; it was the castle clock, and it was
striking twelve at noon. As it finished striking,
they came out at the farther edge of a great bed
of reeds, and there was the castle straight before
them.</p>

<p>Inside the castle lived a lovely lady, and when
she saw Mopsa she took her to her arms. &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo; asked the lovely lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Queen,&rdquo; said Mopsa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my sweet Queen,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;I
know you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you promise that you will be kind to me
until I grow up?&rdquo; inquired Mopsa. &ldquo;Will you
love me and teach me how to reign? I am only
ten years old, and the throne is too big for me to
sit upon, but I am Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;and I will love you
just as if I were your mother.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center"><strong>QUEEN MOPSA</strong></p>

<p>When Mopsa ran through the castle door it shut
suddenly behind her, and Jack was left behind.
After great difficulty he succeeded in climbing the
walls, and crept through a window; and when he
got inside he saw a very wonderful sight. There
was Mopsa in the great audience-room, dressed
superbly in a white satin gown, with a long train
of crimson velvet, which was glittering with
diamonds. It reached almost from one end of the
gallery to the other, and had hundreds of fairies
to hold it to keep it in its place; but in her hair
were no jewels, only a little crown made of
daisies, and on her shoulders her robe was
fastened with a little golden image of a boat.
These things were to show the land she had
come from and the vessel she had come in. At
one side of Mopsa stood the lovely lady; and on
the other, to Jack&#8217;s amazement, a little boy of
his own size, who looked exactly like himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go in,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;There is nothing
to prevent me.&rdquo; He set his foot on the step, and
while he hesitated Mopsa came out to meet him.
He looked at her earnestly, because her lovely
eyes were not looking at him, but far away
toward the west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack lives there,&rdquo; she said, as if speaking to
herself. &ldquo;He will play there again, in his father&#8217;s
garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she brought her eyes down slowly from
the rose-flush in the cloud and looked at him and
said, &ldquo;Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;here I am. What is it that
you wish to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered, &ldquo;I am come to give you back
your kiss.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center"><strong>GOOD-BY TO MOPSA</strong></p>

<p>So she stooped forward as she stood on her step
and kissed him, and her tears fell on his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; she said; and she turned and went
up the steps into the great hall. Jack gazed at
her as she entered, and would fain have followed,
but could not stir, the great doors closed together
again, and he was left outside. Then he knew,
without having been told, that he should never
enter them any more.</p>

<p>Suddenly he perceived that reeds were growing
up between him and the great doors, and he
walked on among them toward the west. Then,
as the rosy sky turned gold color, all on a sudden
he came to the edge of the reed-bed and walked
out upon a rising ground. Jack ran up it, looking
for the castle. At last he saw it, lying so
far, so very far off that all its clear outlines
were lost; and very soon, as it grew dark, they
seemed to mingle with the shapes of the hill and
the forest.</p>

<p>He looked up into the rosy sky, and held out
his arms, and called: &ldquo;Come! Oh, come!&rdquo; In
a minute or two he saw a little black mark overhead,
a small speck, that grew larger and larger.
In another instant he saw a red light and a green
light; then he heard the winnowing noise of a
bird&#8217;s great wings, and suddenly the great white
bird alighted at his feet and said: &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to go home,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; answered the bird.</p>

<p>As Jack flew through the darkness he thought
once again of the little boy who looked just like
himself, who lived in the far castle; and he did
not feel sure whether he himself was upon the
back of the bird or within the castle with Queen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Mopsa. Then he fell asleep, and did not dream
at all, nor know anything more until the great
bird woke him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wake up, now, Jack,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they flew toward the earth Jack saw the
church, and the wood, and his father&#8217;s house,
which seemed to be starting up to meet him. In
two seconds he stepped down into the deep grass
of his father&#8217;s meadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said the great bird. &ldquo;Make haste
and run in, for the dews are falling.&rdquo; And before
he could ask her one question, or even thank
her, she made a wide sweep over the grass, beat
her magnificent wings and soared away.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>JACK COMES HOME</strong></p>

<p>Jack opened the little gate that led into the
garden, stole through the shrubbery and came up
to the drawing-room window and peeped in. His
father and mother were sitting there, his mother
sat with her back to the open window, but a
candle was burning, and she was reading aloud
about a Shepherd Lady and a Lord.</p>

<p>At last his father noticed him, and beckoned
him to come in. So Jack did, and got upon his
father&#8217;s knee, and laid his head on his father&#8217;s
waistcoat, and wondered what he would think if
he should tell him about the fairies that had
been in somebody else&#8217;s waistcoat pocket. He
thought, besides, what a great thing a man is. He
had never seen anything so large in Fairy-land, nor
so important; so, on the whole, he was glad that
he had come back and felt very happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;it must be time this
man of ours was in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So his mother kissed him good-night, and he
went up into his own room and said his prayers.
He got into his little white bed and comfortably
fell asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="BLIND" id="BLIND"></a>THE LINE OF GOLDEN LIGHT,<br /> OR THE LITTLE
BLIND SISTER<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY ELIZABETH HARRISON</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a child whose
name was Avilla; she was sweet and loving, and
fair to look upon, with everything in the world to
make her happy&mdash;but she had a little blind sister,
and Avilla could not be perfectly happy as long
as her sister&#8217;s eyes were closed so that she could
not see God&#8217;s beautiful world, nor enjoy His
bright sunshine. Little Avilla kept wondering
if there was not something that she could do
which would open this blind sister&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>At last, one day, she heard of an old, old woman,
nobody knew how old, who had lived for hundreds
of years in a dark cave, not many miles
away. This queer, old woman knew a secret
enchantment, by means of which the blind could
receive their sight. The child Avilla asked her
parents&#8217; permission to make a journey to the cave,
in order that she might try to persuade the old
woman to tell her this secret. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed
she, joyfully, &ldquo;my dear sister need sit no longer
in darkness.&rdquo; Her parents gave a somewhat unwilling
consent, as they heard many strange and
wicked stories about the old woman. At last,
however, one fine spring morning, Avilla started
on her journey. She had a long distance to
walk, but the happy thoughts in her heart made
the time pass quickly, and the soft, cool breeze
seemed to be whispering a song to her all the
way.</p>

<p>When she came to the mouth of the cave, it
looked so dark and forbidding that she almost
feared to enter it, but the thought of her little
blind sister gave her courage, and she walked in.
At first she could see nothing, for all the sunshine
was shut out by the frowning rocks that guarded
the entrance. Soon, however, she discerned the
old woman sitting on a stone chair, spinning a pile
of flax into a fine, fine thread. She seemed bent
nearly double with age, and her face wore a look
of worry and care, which made her appear older.</p>

<p>The child Avilla came close to her side, and
thought, she is so aged that she must be hard of
hearing. The old woman did not turn her head,
nor stop her spinning. Avilla waited a moment,
and then took fresh courage, and said, &ldquo;I have
come to ask you if you will tell me how I can
cure my blind sister?&rdquo; The strange creature
turned and stared at her as if she were very much
surprised; she then spoke in a deep, hollow voice,
so hollow that it sounded as if she had not
spoken for a very long time. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she with
a sneer, &ldquo;I can tell you well enough, but you&#8217;ll not
do it. People who can see, trouble themselves
very little about those who are blind!&rdquo; This last
was said with a sigh, and then she scowled at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Avilla until the child&#8217;s heart began to beat very
fast. But the thought of her little blind sister
made her brave again, and she cried out, &ldquo;Oh
please tell me. I will do anything to help my
dear sister!&rdquo; The old woman looked long and
earnestly at her this time. She then stooped
down and searched in the heap of the fine-spun
thread which lay at her side until she found the
end of it. This she held out to the child, saying,
&ldquo;Take this and carry it all around the world, and
when you have done that, come to me and I will
show you how your blind sister may be cured.&rdquo;
Little Avilla thanked her and eagerly seized the
tiny thread, and wrapping it carefully around her
hand that she might not lose it, turned and
hastened out of the close, damp cave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/img137.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;avilla ran forward and cried:<br />
&lsquo;now give sight to my sister&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had not traveled far before she looked back
to be sure the thread had not broken, it was so
thin. Imagine her surprise to see that instead
of its being a gray thread of spun flax, it was a
thread of golden light, that glittered and shone
in the sunlight, as if it were made of the most
precious stuff on earth. She felt sure now that
it must be a magic thread, and that it somehow
would help her to cure her blind sister. So she
hastened on, glad and happy.</p>

<p>Soon, however, she approached a dark, dense
forest. No ray of sunlight seemed ever to have
fallen on the trunks of its trees. In the distance
she thought she could hear the growl of bears and
the roar of lions. Her heart almost stopped beating.
&ldquo;Oh, I can never go through that gloomy
forest,&rdquo; said she to herself, and her eyes filled
with tears. She turned to retrace her steps, when
the soft breeze which still accompanied her whispered:
&ldquo;Look at the thread you have been carrying!
Look at the golden thread!&rdquo; She looked
back, and the bright, tiny line of light seemed to
be actually smiling at her, as it stretched across
the soft greensward, far into the distance, and,
strange to say, each tiny blade of grass which it
had touched, had blossomed into a flower. So, as
the little girl looked back, she saw a flowery path
with a glittering line of golden light running
through it. &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
did not notice the flowers as I came along, but
the enchanted thread will make the next traveler
see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This thought filled her with such joy that she
pushed forward into the dark woods. Sometimes
she knocked her head against a tree which stood
in her way; sometimes she almost feared she was
lost, but every now and then she would look back
and the sight of the tiny thread of golden light
always renewed her courage. Once in a while
she felt quite sure that she could see the nose of
some wild beast poking out in front of her, but
when she came nearer it proved to be the joint in
a tree trunk, or some strange fungus which had
grown on a low branch. Then she would laugh
at her own fear and go on. One of the wonderful
things about the mysterious little thread which
she carried in her hand was, that it seemed to
open a path behind it, so that one could easily
follow in her footsteps without stumbling over
fallen trees, or bumping against living ones. Every
now and then a gray squirrel would frisk by her
in a friendly fashion, as if to assure her that she
was not alone, even in the twilight of the dark
woods. By and by she came to the part of the
forest where the trees were less dense, and soon
she was out in the glad sunshine again.</p>

<p>But now a new difficulty faced her. As far as
she could see stretched a low, swampy marsh of
wet land. The mud and slime did not look very
inviting, but the thought of her little blind sister
came to her again, and she bravely plunged into
the mire. The dirty, dripping mud clung to her
dress and made her feet so heavy that she grew
weary lifting them out of it. Sometimes she
seemed to be stuck fast, and it was only with a
great effort that she could pull out, first one foot,
and then the other. A lively green frog hopped
along beside her, and seemed to say, in his funny,
croaking voice, &ldquo;Never mind the mud, you&#8217;ll
soon be through it.&rdquo; When she had at last
reached the end of the slippery, sticky marsh, and
stood once more on firm ground, she looked back
at the tiny thread of golden light which trailed
along after her. What do you think had happened?
Wherever the mysterious and beautiful
thread had touched the mud, the water had dried
up, and the earth had become firm and hard, so
that any other person who might wish to cross
the swampy place could walk on firm ground.
This made the child Avilla so happy that she
began to sing softly to herself.</p>

<p>Soon, however, her singing ceased. As the
day advanced, the air grew hotter and hotter. The
trees had long ago disappeared, and now the
grass became parched and dry, until at last she
found herself in the midst of a dreary desert. For
miles and miles the scorching sand stretched on
every side. She could not even find a friendly
rock in whose shadow she might rest for a time.
The blazing sun hurt her eyes and made her head
ache, and the hot sand burned her feet. Still
she toiled on, cheered by a swarm of yellow
butterflies that fluttered just ahead of her. At
last the end of the desert was reached, just as the
sun disappeared behind a crimson cloud. Dusty
and weary, the child Avilla was about to throw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
herself down on the ground to rest. As she did
so, her eyes turned to look once more at the
golden thread which had trailed behind her all
day on the hot sand. Lo, and behold! What did
she see? Tall shade trees had sprung up along
the path she had traveled, and each tiny grain
of sand that the wonderful thread had touched
was now changed into a diamond, or ruby, or
emerald, or some other precious stone. On one
side the pathway across the desert shone and
glittered, while on the other the graceful trees
cast a cool and refreshing shade.</p>

<p>Little Avilla stood amazed as she looked at the
beautiful trees and the sparkling gems. All feeling
of weariness was gone. The air now seemed
mild and refreshing, and she thought that she
could hear in the distance some birds singing their
evening songs. One by one the bright stars
came out in the quiet sky above her head, as if
to keep guard while she slept through the night.</p>

<p>The next morning she started forward on her
long journey round the world. She traveled
quite pleasantly for a while, thinking of how
cool and shady the desert path would now be for
any one who might have to travel it, and of the
precious jewels she had left for some one else
to gather up. She could not stop for them herself,
she was too anxious to press forward and
finish her task, in order that her little blind sister
might the sooner see.</p>

<p>After a time she came to some rough rocks
tumbled about in great confusion, as if angry
giants had hurled them at each other. Soon the
path grew steeper and steeper, and the rocks
sharper and sharper, until they cut her feet. Before
her she could see nothing but more rocks until
they piled themselves into a great mountain,
which frowned down upon her, as much as to
say, &ldquo;How dare you attempt to climb to my summit?&rdquo;
The brave child hesitated. Just then two
strong eagles with outspread wings rose from
their nest of sticks on the side of a steep cliff
near by, and soared majestically and slowly aloft.
As they passed far above her head they uttered a
loud cry which seemed to say, &ldquo;Be brave and
strong and you shall meet us at the mountain-top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes the ragged edges of the rocks tore
her dress, and sometimes they caught the tiny
golden thread, and tangled it so that she had to
turn back and loosen it from their hold. The
road was very steep and she was compelled to sit
down every few minutes and get her breath.
Still she climbed on, keeping the soaring eagles
always in sight. As she neared the top, she
turned and looked back at the enchanted thread of
golden light which she had carried through all the
long, strange journey. Another marvelous thing
had happened! The rugged path of sharp, broken
rocks had changed into broad and beautiful white
marble steps, over which trailed the shining
thread of light. She knew that she had made a
pathway up this difficult mountain and her heart
rejoiced.</p>

<p>She turned again to proceed on her journey,
when, only a short distance in front of her, she
saw the dark cave in which lived the strange old
woman who had bidden her carry the line of
light around the world. She hastened forward,
and on entering the cave, she saw the old creature,
almost bent double, still spinning the mysterious
thread. Avilla ran forward and cried out, &ldquo;I
have done all you told me to do, now give sight
to my sister.&rdquo; The old woman sprang to her
feet, seized the thread of golden light and exclaimed,
&ldquo;At last! at last! I am freed! The spell
has now been broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came so strange and wonderful a change
that Avilla could hardly believe her own eyes.
Instead of the ugly, cross-looking old crone, there
stood a beautiful princess, with long golden hair,
and tender blue eyes, her face radiant with joy.
Her story was soon told. Hundreds of years ago
she had been changed into the bent old woman,
and shut up in the dark cave on the mountain-side,
because she, a daughter of the King, had
been selfish and idle, thinking only of herself,
and her punishment had been that she must remain
thus disguised and separated from all companions
and friends until she could find someone
who would be generous and brave enough to
take the long, dangerous journey around the world
for the sake of others. Her mother had been a
fairy princess and had taught her many things
which we mortals have yet to learn. She showed
the child Avilla how, by dipping the golden thread
into a spring of ordinary water, she could change
the water into golden water, which glittered and
sparkled like liquid sunshine. Filling a pitcher
with this they hastened together to where the
little blind sister sat in darkness waiting for some
one to come and lead her home. The beautiful
princess told Avilla to dip her hands into the
bowl of enchanted water, and then press them
upon the closed eyes of her sister. They opened!
And the little blind girl could see!</p>

<p>After that the fairy princess came and lived
with little Avilla and her sister, and taught them
how to do many wonderful things, of which I
have not time to tell you to-day.</p></div>

</div>


<p>The Mermaids and the Sea-gulls were collected
in crowds upon the shore. There was hardly a
sound except the monotonous splash of little
waves breaking, and the rippling rattle of the
shingle as it followed the water returning. Thousands
of eyes were fixed upon the piece of rocky
land that jutted out into the sea, where the Philosopher&#8217;s
magnificent castle stood, or <em>had</em> stood,
for there was now very little of it left. No wonder
the Mermaids and the Mer-babies and the
Sea-gulls were astonished. Even the sea was
speckled with fish who were putting their heads
out of the water to watch. For the Philosopher&#8217;s
castle was fading away, melting like mist before
the sun!</p>

<p>The Philosopher himself could be seen rushing
about, tearing his scanty white hair. That
was another equally astonishing thing, for only
yesterday the Philosopher had been young and
handsome, as well as the richest and greatest
man in all the land&mdash;so rich and great that he
was to have married the Princess very soon.</p>

<p>Now he was old and wild and gaunt. A tattered
brown cloak with rents and holes in it
hung from his thin shoulders, flapping as he ran
about, and all his dingy dress was dirty and
ragged. He looked like a wandering peddler.
What had become of his many servants? Where
were his horses and chariots, and the strange
beasts from foreign lands which had wandered
in the beautiful gardens&mdash;the gardens with the
pavilions, where all the flowers had been in
bloom for the Princess?</p>

<p>There was only one tower standing now, and
the top of that was growing more and more
flimsy. Presently, through the walls, rooms could
be seen. In one of them there stood a golden
cage, and in it was a Parrot.</p>

<p>Very soon the bars of the cage were like cobwebs,
and the Parrot began to tear them apart.
Then he spread his wings with a joyful scream,
and flew on to the rocks, above the heads of the
crowds upon the shore.</p>

<p>Immediately every one called a different question
to the Parrot, who smoothed his feathers
and took no notice until, when the noise and excitement
were rather less, an old Sea-gull spoke
for them all. Then the new-comer consented to
tell what he knew of the events of the day.</p>

<p>It was due, he said, to the Philosopher&#8217;s having
lost the Magic Stone. Upon this stone his youthful
appearance, and everything that he owned,
had depended.</p>

<p>Early that morning a great tumult had suddenly
arisen. The Philosopher went out walking.
Soon an old man had rushed in, crying
that he had lost the Magic Stone. He commanded
every slave in the castle instantly to
leave whatever work he was doing, and help to
find it. At first no one heeded him, for they
could not any of them be persuaded that he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
their master. Then the confusion had grown
rapidly worse, for each one found he was fading
away, growing every moment more pale and
thin. As the hours passed all the servants became
white ghosts, and they floated away in companies
together.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 163px;">
<img src="images/img141.jpg" width="163" height="500" alt="Everyone called a different question to the parrot" title="" />
</div>

<p>The furniture was melting now in the same
manner. The tables were sinking down, and all
the vessels used for cooking, and what not, were
falling softly and noiselessly upon the floors&mdash;where
there were any floors to hold them. Everything
was blowing gently about, so that the air
seemed filled with bits of cloud. Presently the
remnants would be swept into the sea by the
passing breezes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how have you escaped?&rdquo; asked the Sea-gull.</p>

<p>The Parrot raised his crest and looked very
much offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because <em>I</em> am real,&rdquo; he said with dignity.
&ldquo;I was the only real thing in the castle. The
Philosopher stole me at the same time that he
stole the Magic Stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stole it?&rdquo; cried the Mermaids and the Mer-babies
and the Sea-gulls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Parrot; &ldquo;he stole it in a far-off
land, and he stole me. I was to be a present to
the Princess; for he thought of marrying the
Princess even at that time, and the Philosopher
knew there was not in all the world another parrot
like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his wings and puffed up every feather.
He certainly was a magnificent creature.
The grown-up Sea-gulls felt quite ashamed of
their homely dresses of black and white; but the
young ones only gaped, and crowded open-mouthed
to the front to look.</p>

<p>The Parrot&#8217;s snowy coat shaded different colors
like opals when he moved, and each feather
was edged with gold. The crest upon his head
sparkled as if there were diamonds in it, and
under his wings he was rose-red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am free!&rdquo; he cried, as the diamonds
glittered and flashed,&mdash;&ldquo;free to go home where
the palm-trees grow, and the sun shines as it
never shines in this chilly land! Look well at
me while you can, for you will never see me
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he poised a moment above them,
then sailed away to the South, like a gorgeous
monster butterfly. And they never did see him
again.</p>

<p>When they had watched him out of sight, and
turned again, there was nothing remaining of
the castle, and the Philosopher, too, had disappeared.
The sun was setting, and the Mermaids
and the Mer-babies went to their homes in the
sea, while the Sea-gulls put their little gulls to
bed in the nests among the rocks high above the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
restless waves.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Now all the talk was of the Philosopher&#8217;s
Magic Stone, and who should find it. And at
court every one was discussing how this unexpected
turn of events would affect the Princess&#8217;s
marriage. It was to have taken place in a very
short time. The King was very angry. He considered
that a slight had been cast upon the
Princess and upon himself by the carelessness of
the Philosopher. He was not well pleased, either,
to know that the great wealth of the man who
was to have been his son-in-law was all due to
magic influences. Neither did he like what he
heard of the Philosopher&#8217;s appearance when last
he was seen. He announced that the Princess&#8217;s
wedding would take place at the time fixed, and
that she should be married to the first Prince, or
other suitable candidate, who arrived on that
day. And even the Philosopher might take his
chance of being the first, if he were then in a
position to support the Princess in the luxury
to which she had been accustomed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<img src="images/img142.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="Do you think the Philosopher will find the stone? She asked of the eldest lady-in-waiting" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the Princess herself, what did she think
of it all? No one knew, for she did not say.
She sat at her palace window, and looked out
over the distant mountains, and dreamed of her
wedding day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Philosopher will find the
Stone?&rdquo; she asked of the Eldest Lady-in-Waiting,
who was in attendance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may well hope so, your Royal Highness,&rdquo;
said the Eldest Lady. &ldquo;He is a great man and
wise. I hear, too, that he had been walking only
a short distance from the castle when he lost the
Stone. It can hardly fail to be found very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess sat still and looked over toward
the mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the Philosopher will find the
Stone?&rdquo; she asked presently of the Youngest
and Favorite Lady-in-Waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! your Royal Highness, I fear it is not
likely,&rdquo; said the Favorite Lady. &ldquo;All the Sea-people
have been searching day and night, I
hear, and nothing has been heard of it yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess smiled. She still sat and smiled
when the Favorite Lady wrapped a cloak about
herself, and took a letter that lay by the Princess&#8217;s
hand. Then, without permission or instruction,
she set out toward the mountains. The
Princess rested her elbows on the window-ledge,
and watched her out of sight, and perhaps wondered
who would be the earliest to arrive, and
so fill the place of bridegroom, on her wedding-day.</p>

<p>And all this time, as the Lady-in-Waiting had
said, the Sea-people had been searching day and
night.</p>

<p>The Mer-babies and the little Sea-gulls were
quite neglected, and did no lessons; for every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
one was too busy to attend to them. They played
about and romped on the shore when they grew
tired of hunting for the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone.
The Sea-gulls had told the land-birds, who were
searching the woods and the fields, while the
fresh-water fish knew of it from their relatives
in the sea, and they were searching the lakes
and the rivers. Then the Sea-gulls determined
to consult the Great Albatross of the Southern
Seas, the King among all sea-fowl. They arrived
one sunny morning, and found him expecting
them, for he had heard what had happened&mdash;in
the first place from the Parrot, who had passed
that way. So he was prepared with his answer.
It did not satisfy the Sea-gulls at all. They went
away very much disappointed, for the Albatross
was in a bad temper, and said only:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home and attend to the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited about until late, but he would say
nothing more. So they were obliged to return
and confess their want of success to the Mermaids,
who sympathized with them, and agreed
that it was very ill-natured of the Albatross.
They proposed to go to the Sea-serpent and ask
his advice, which the Sea-gulls thought a good
plan. They set off at once for the deep seas,
where he lived, inquiring of the fish they met
whether any news had been heard. But the fish
had nothing to tell, and the Mermaids came to
the Sea-serpent&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>He was curled on his great rock throne, with
giant seaweeds of all colors waving round him,
and the stars of the anemones gleaming out from
dark corners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img143.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="Consulting the wise white bear" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sea-serpent listened to the request of the
Mermaids; but they met with no better luck than
the Sea-gulls, for he said exactly the same: &ldquo;Go
home and attend to the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he retired into the great caves, and would
not come out again.</p>

<p>So the Mermaids went home disconsolate.
They began to think they might have to give up
the hope of finding the Magic Stone.</p>

<p>Of course the Mer-babies heard all that was
going on. They discussed the situation, as usual.
They did not mean to be left behind in this business,
though they were not considered to be of
any consequence. It was evidently correct to
consult somebody who lived at a distance, and
they thought of the Wise White Bear. He was
farther off, too, than either the Albatross or the
Sea-serpent, for he lived at the north pole; but
when he was mentioned the very young Mer-babies
for once suggested that it was nearly bedtime,
and they found that they were sleepy. Some
one whispered that the White Bear ate the poor
seals, and the youngest Mer-babies crept into
holes in the rocks to rest, they said, while the
little Sea-gulls went walking home, one behind
the other, right across the sands, without having
been called. But the older Mer-babies set off for
the north pole.</p>

<p>They arrived home next morning, very tired
and very cross. When the sleepy ones who had
stayed behind asked what the Wise Bear had
said, they would not tell, and for the first time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the Mer-babies quarreled. They declared in the
end that they would none of them look for the
&ldquo;Philosopher&#8217;s ugly Stone ever any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So if the Princess really wanted to marry the
Philosopher, that day she lost some of her helpers.
But no one knew what she wished, for she
never mentioned him. She sat at her window
that looked out over the mountains, and she
gazed ever outward.</p>

<p>It was the night before her wedding. She had
been there all day, and for many days. It was
very quiet, and the lamps were lighted. The
Eldest Lady-in-Waiting spread out the lovely
robes, ready for the morrow, where the Princess
might see them; but she never moved nor spoke.
As midnight approached she leaned out and let
the soft wind blow upon her face.</p>

<p>The hour of midnight was striking from all
the belfries, when a great clatter sounded down
below in the courtyard. Horses neighed, and
men ran about. The Princess leaned more forward,
and listened. Then a horseman, whose
jewels sparkled in the moonlight, looked up and
kissed a hand to her, and she kissed hers to him.
It was one minute past midnight, and the morning
of her wedding-day! She dropped the curtains
and turned to greet the Favorite Lady-in-Waiting,
who had come in. The Princess threw
her arms round her Lady&#8217;s neck to welcome her
back, she was so glad and happy.</p>

<p>So it came about that the Prince of the City
Over the Mountains was the first to arrive on
that eventful morning; for, though through all
the rest of the night, and up to the very hour of
the wedding, noble Princes and their retinues
were received in state by the King, all of them
had to be told that they were too late, and most
of them rode off again at once. Some who had
never seen the Princess, but who had been attracted
by reports of her beauty and her stateliness,
waited to attend her marriage feast, and
to regret that they had not hurried themselves a
little more.</p>

<p>As for the Philosopher, who should have been
one of the chief persons of interest on that important
occasion, no one even thought of him,
unless the Princess did. But she looked too well
pleased for any one to suppose she missed him&mdash;which
was fortunate, for he was never heard of
any more.</p>

<p>When the eventful day was past, the Mermaids
and the Sea-gulls covered the shore once again,
talking it over, and the Mer-babies and the little
Sea-gulls stood around listening.</p>

<p>Presently the Mer-mothers said: &ldquo;No more
holidays. Lessons to-morrow!&rdquo; and the Mer-babies
sighed, and the little Sea-gulls looked
gloomy.</p>

<p>One of the Mer-babies stepped forward, holding
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please take care of our pretty ball for us,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;until holidays come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she was speaking the Mermaids sprang up,
and they and all the grown-up Sea-gulls cried
with one accord:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Philosopher&#8217;s Stone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, sure enough, it was. It lay in the Mermaid&#8217;s
hand, all glowing with its magic blue, pale
and dark by turns, its wonderful veins panting
as if it were a living thing, its threads of gold
moving and twining underneath, round the red
heart burning deep in the midst of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; cried every one of the Mer-babies and
every one of the little Sea-gulls. &ldquo;Why, we have
had <em>that</em> all the time! We found it on the sand,
and we have played with it every day since!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Sea-gulls remembered what the Albatross
had said, and the Mermaids remembered
what the Sea-serpent had said, and the Mer-babies
remembered what the Wise White Bear
had said, and they all looked at one another.</p>

<p>Now arose the question, What should be done
with the Stone?</p>

<p>It needed no long discussion to settle. Every
one agreed that it should be given to the Youngest
Lady-in-Waiting; for she had done for the
Princess what no one else had thought of doing,
in carrying her letter to her true love so that he
might be in time to win her. The happy day just
past was entirely owing to her devotion.</p>

<p>The Stone was duly presented to her, and, accordingly,
she became the richest and most beautiful
woman in the land, as she was already the
kindest, while the Sea-folks generally, and the
Mer-babies in particular, gained great fame and
distinction; for had they not found the Magic
Stone when it was lost, and given it to the nation&#8217;s
favorite? And they do say that the Favorite
Lady-in-Waiting married a charming Prince almost
(but not quite!) as captivating as the husband
of the Princess.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a dainty little kingdom all
parks and rivers and cottages and flowers, there
lived a jolly, red-faced king named Rudolpho.
Every one of his subjects loved him, the surrounding
kings were his loyal friends, and the
neighboring kingdoms were on the best of terms
with him. Indeed, they had a happy way, these
old kings, of exchanging thrones for a week now
and then, just as some preachers nowadays exchange
pulpits&mdash;to prove, I suppose, how very
good their own is, after all. This king about
whom I am telling you was fat, of course, and
looked very like our good friend Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Yet, strange as it may seem, with all these
blessings&mdash;a rich kingdom, faithful subjects, and
a loving wife&mdash;this good king was not happy.
There was one cloud, a very pretty silver-edged
cloud, but yet a cloud, which hung just in front
of the sun of his happiness and cast a great big
shadow.</p>

<p>The king had a daughter, the Princess Madge,
his only child; and though she was obedient in
everything else, she just wouldn&#8217;t, <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em>,
marry. Now the king was very anxious for her
to marry and settle down on the throne, because
he was growing old. Every morning for three
weeks, just before breakfast, he had had three
separate twinges of pain. The queen said it was
because of his rheumatism, but he knew better;
he was sure that it was old age, and it made him
very eager to have the kingdom in the hands of
the new son-in-law king before he died.</p>

<p>Of course there were plenty of princes and
dukes and barons and lords who would gladly
have wedded the pretty princess for her own
sweet sake alone, to say nothing of the prospect
of being king some day, but she wouldn&#8217;t have
one of them. There was not a man in the kingdom
nor in any of the surrounding kingdoms who
suited her capricious fancy. Princes of haughty
mien, princes of gentle manner, handsome princes,
ugly princes, tall princes, short princes, fat
princes, lean princes, had been introduced at the
court, had been encouraged by the king and
queen, and had sought to gain her favor. She
had been showered with gifts of rare flowers and
precious stones, and had received thousands of
little letters smelling of perfume; but from prince,
from jewels, and from written vows of love she
turned away with the same cheerful determination.</p>

<p>A princess is a lonely little body, you know,
and custom was so rigid in the time of the
Princess Madge that she had no one to talk to
excepting Pussy Willow, the royal kitten. She
had no brother, no sister, no cousin, and no
dearest friend. She didn&#8217;t even have a chance
to speak freely to her own father and mother.
It is true, she took breakfast with them every
morning at eleven in the great breakfast-room,
but the butlers and waiters and pages and flunkies
were always standing about, with their ears
pricked up and their eyes bulging out, so that
no one dared whisper a secret or have even the
jolliest little family quarrel. It is true her royal
mama came at precisely ten o&#8217;clock to kiss her
good night every evening, but there were always
a dozen maids and ladies in waiting, and it was
impossible to have a real good talk. But Pussy
Willow was her constant companion, and to
Pussy she told everything. That friendly cat was
the only living thing in the whole kingdom that
really knew that the princess intended to marry
sometime. That was what worried the king and
queen so much; Madge made them believe that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
she would never marry any one, never, <em>never</em>,
<span class="smcap">never</span>, but would live alone to the end of her
days and leave the kingdom to any one who
wished for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img147.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="Came at precisely ten o&#8217;clock to kiss her goodnight" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Pussy, I wouldn&#8217;t tell a story to the king and
queen for the world, but isn&#8217;t it fun to see them
take on so? If I really thought that papa was
ill and likely to die, I would be as good as gold;
but those little pains of his are only rheumatism,
I am sure, so I don&#8217;t mind teasing him just a
little. You know, Pussy, that when my ideal
comes&mdash;oh, you needn&#8217;t look up and blink in such
surprise, for I really have an ideal, and I will
tell you all about him!&rdquo; Whereupon Pussy shook
her head till her gold-bell necklace tinkled loudly,
then she yawned a little and began to wash her
face. She looked very wise as she sat there
stroking her whiskers and thumping thoughtfully
on the floor with her bunchy tail. After thinking
thus seriously for a few minutes, she suddenly
began a sympathetic little purr-song which
seemed to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, little mistress; I am all ready to listen,
and I&#8217;ll not tell a soul.&rdquo; Then Princess Madge
continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t care whether he is prince or pauper,
high or low, handsome or plain; but he must in
any case be contented. You know what contented
means, Pussy&mdash;satisfied with what he has until
he deserves and can get something better. If he
is like that he will always be unselfish and happy.
Oh, yes, and I shall be happy, too. Now I am
going to write a letter to papa and tell him that
I will marry if he will find me a contented man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quick as thought, the princess opened her rose-wood
and gold desk, drew out some paper with
her crest on it and a jeweled pen, and wrote
daintily and carefully. It took her a very long
time, Pussy Willow thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, kitty, listen; I will read it to you:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;To his Majesty the King, from her Royal Highness,
the Princess Madge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Old Papa</span>: I have at last decided to be married
if you can find a man to suit me. Now read, my dear
papa, and remember that this decision is final. I will
marry the first contented man you can find, no matter who
he is. Read this little poem; it is my guiding star at this
very serious time:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a jewel which no Indian mine can buy,</span><br />
  No chemic art can counterfeit.<br />
  It makes men rich in greatest poverty,<br />
  Makes water wine, turns wooden cups to gold.<br />
  Seldom it comes, to few from heaven sent,<br />
  That much in little, all in naught&mdash;<em>content</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I have written, I have written.<br />
               <span style="margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 6em;">&ldquo;Your own</span> <span class="smcap">Madge</span>.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds very well, doesn&#8217;t it, Pussy?
I am going to fold it so, and so, then cut off
a strand of my hair&mdash;see, Pussy, it is nearly a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
yard long, and it will go around and around this
letter and tie in a great golden knot. When the
king sees that he will know it is very important.
Now I will go to the door and tell the page to
run with this to papa, and then&mdash;oh, I wonder
what he will say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran to the door, spoke a few words to the
page who stood just outside, then returned to the
great cushioned chair by the window. Pussy
climbed into her lap. They both winked a few
times and blinked a few times and then fell fast
asleep.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>II</strong></p>

<p>Half an hour later the king, with his crown comfortably
pushed back on his head, and a smile
very much all over his ruddy face, burst into the
queen&#8217;s sitting-room. He held a tangle of golden
hair in one hand and a sheet of blue note-paper
in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, my dear, what do you think has
happened? Here, written by her own hand, the
hand of the Princess Madge, are the happy words
which drive away all our fears. She will marry,
my dear, she will marry; and listen: she cares
not what may be his rank or age or condition&mdash;he
must be a <em>contented</em> man, that is all. Oh, what
a child, what a child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rudolpho, my love, is it true? Why, why,
I am so happy! Is it really true? Do give me
my fan. Yes, thank you. Fan me, dear; a little
faster. It quite took my breath away. Just to
think of that! Now go at once and issue a royal
edict summoning every contented man in this
kingdom and in all the surrounding kingdoms to
a grand feast here in the palace. After the
feast we will hold a trial, and the Princess Madge
shall be the judge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away rushed the king, the pages in waiting
outside the door vainly trying to catch the end of
his fluttering robe.</p>

<p>The next day a cavalcade of heralds set out
from the palace gates, bearing posters which
were hung in the market-place of every village
for leagues about. In blue letters on a gold
ground were these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Ho, ye! Hear, ye! Ho, ye!</p>

<p>On the twenty-third day of the month now present,
every <em>contented</em> man throughout the universe is summoned
to the court of King Rudolpho for a feast and a trial for
the hand of the Princess Madge. He among you all who
is absolutely contented shall have the princess&#8217;s hand in
marriage, together with half the kingdom. Every man
will be tried by the princess herself. Every man who
falls short and stands not the test shall never again enter
King Rudolpho&#8217;s court.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 16em;">
  My hand <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; My seal <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">+</span>.<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;" class="smcap">Rudolpho</span>, <em>Rex</em>.</p></div>

<p>The day dawned, brilliant and glorious. How
the contented men jostled each other, and frowned
at each other, and scolded each other as they
thronged through the palace gates! They all
gathered in the banquet-hall, where a wonderful
feast was spread&mdash;a roasted ox, with wild boar
and lamb and turkey and peacock, and a hundred
kinds of fruit, and fifty kinds of ice-water; but
as a dinner-party it was not a success. Conversation
was dull, each man glowered at his
neighbor, and all seemed eager to finish the feast
and begin the trial.</p>

<p>Finally it was over, and five hundred and fifty
contented men assembled in the royal court-room.
The king and queen were seated on their thrones,
but the princess was nowhere to be seen. There
was a moment of breathless waiting&mdash;then suddenly
a door at the side of the court-room opened
and the Princess Madge, carrying Pussy Willow,
entered and was followed by her train-bearers
and maids of honor. She wore a wonderful
gown all white and gold down the front, with
the foamiest of sea-foam green trains hanging
from her shoulders away out behind her. Slowly,
majestically, she walked across the room, and
stopped before a table on which lay a golden
gavel. A quick tap of the gavel silenced the
little murmur that had arisen at her entrance.
The king glanced at the queen, and they both
smiled with pride in their stately daughter. The
princess tapped again and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princes, baronets, honorables, commons of
this kingdom and our neighboring kingdoms, I
bid you welcome. You have come to sue for my
hand and my fortune. I know full well, my
noble men, that if I asked it you would gladly
give me some great proof of your bravery and
goodness&mdash;but I ask you to take no risk and make
no sacrifice. I merely wish to know whether I
can find in any of you that secret of all true
courage and happiness&mdash;contentment. Now let
every man of you who is contented, <em>thoroughly
contented</em>, rise. Remember, there are no degrees
in contentment; it is absolute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The black-robed throng arose&mdash;some eagerly,
some impatiently, some disdainfully, some few
slowly and thoughtfully, but they all stood and
waited in utter silence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/img149.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="The Princess Madge Enters" title="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&ldquo;As I put the test question, if there is any one
who cannot answer it, let him go quietly out
through yonder door and never again show his
discontented face in this court. You say you
are contented&mdash;happy, unselfish, and satisfied with
what the gods have given you. Answer me this!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Why, then, do you scowl and jostle one another?
Why do you want to marry any one&mdash;least of all,
a princess with half the riches of a great kingdom
as a dowry, to spoil your happiness? Greedy
fortune-hunters! Do you call that contentment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contented men stood a moment in baffled
silence, then turned, one and all, and slowly
marched out of the room. As the door closed
upon the last one of the disappointed suitors, the
princess picked up her pretty kitten and, turning
to her father and mother, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have me marry one of <em>those</em>?
Why, they aren&#8217;t half so contented as a common,
everyday pussy-cat. Good-by!&rdquo; And she
laughed a merry laugh, threw a kiss at the
astonished king and queen, and ran from the
room.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>III</strong></p>

<p>At luncheon one day many months after the
dismissal of the discontented suitors, the prime
minister entered the dining-room and announced
to the king that a man had been found within the
palace gates without a royal permit, and had been
immediately put in the dungeon. He was a handsome
fellow, the prime minister said, but very
poorly clad. He made no resistance when he was
taken prisoner, but earnestly requested that his
trial might come off as soon as possible, as he
rather wanted to make a sketch of the palace and
gardens, and he couldn&#8217;t see very well from the
slit in the top of the dungeon; but he begged
them not to put themselves nor the king to any
inconvenience, as he could just as well remain
where he was and write poems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In sooth, your Majesty,&rdquo; said the prime minister,
in conclusion, &ldquo;from all we have heard and
seen, it seemeth that at last we have found a
contented man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the king finished his royal repast
he disguised himself in the long cloak and hat
of a soldier and went with the prime minister and
the turnkey to catch a glimpse of the prisoner.
As they approached the dungeon they heard a
rich bass voice singing:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.2em;">&ldquo;Let the world slide, let the world go!</span><br />
 A fig for care, and a fig for woe.<br />
 If I must stay, why, I can&#8217;t go,<br />
 And love makes equal the high and low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king drew nearer, stooped, and peeped
through the keyhole. Just opposite the door, on
a three-legged stool, sat the prisoner. His head
was thrown back and he was looking at the sky
through the bars in the top of his cell. The song
had ceased and he was talking softly to himself.
The king, in a whisper, told the prime minister
to bring the princess and have her remain hidden
just outside the door. Then he motioned to the
turnkey to throw back the bolts, and he entered
the dungeon alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you talking to yourself, man?&rdquo; he
asked. The man answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, soldier, I like to talk to a sensible
man, and I like to hear a sensible man talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the king. &ldquo;Pretty good,
pret-ty good! They tell me that all things please
you. Is it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can safely say yes, soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why are you so poorly clad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The care of fine clothes is too much of a
burden&mdash;I have long ago refused to be fashion&#8217;s
slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of those that I have had, the good are dead,
and happier so than here; the evil ones have
left me and are befriending some one else, for
which I say, &lsquo;Joy go with them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is there nothing that you want?&rdquo; As the
king asked this question he looked at the man in
a peculiarly eager way, nor did the answer disappoint
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have all of the necessities of life and many
of the luxuries. I am perfectly content. I know
I have neither land nor money, but is not the
whole world mine? Can even the king himself
take from me my delight in the green trees and
the greener fields, in that dainty little cloud flecking
heaven&#8217;s blue up yonder like a bit of foam on
a sunlit sea? Oh, no! I am rich enough, for all
nature is mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <em>I</em> am yours,&rdquo; said a sweet young voice.
The man looked up in surprise, and there before
him, holding out her pretty hands toward him,
stood the Princess Madge, who had slipped into
the cell unnoticed.</p>

<p>The man sprang to his feet, clasped the little
hands in his, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not what you mean, sweet lady, when
you say that you are mine; but oh, you are passing
beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; called the princess, &ldquo;this is quite dreadful.
Quick, take off that ugly soldier&#8217;s coat and
tell him who we are and all about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king, starting as if from a dream, threw
off the rough coat and hat and stepped forth
into the beam of sunlight, resplendent in gold
and ermine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou dost not know me, my man? I am the
king. Hast thou not read our last proclamation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty; I never do read proclamations.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/img151.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="I am Perfectly Content" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then thou didst not know that the hand of
the princess is offered to the first contented man
who enters the palace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty; I knew it not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then know it now, and know, too, that thou
art the man. To thee I give my daughter, together
with half my kingdom. No, no&mdash;not a
word. Thou deservest her. May you be happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prisoner, almost dumb with astonishment, almost
dazed with joy, knelt and kissed the princess&#8217;s
white hands, then looked into her eyes and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well it is for me that I saw you not until
now, for I should have been miserably discontented
until you were mine!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE FLYING SHIP</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Russian Tale</em></p>


<p>Once upon a time there was a Princess who
was always wanting something new and strange.
She would not look at the princes who came to
woo her from the kingdoms round about, because,
she said, they all came in the same way, in carriages
which had four wheels and were drawn
by four horses. &ldquo;Why could not one come in a
carriage with five wheels?&rdquo; she exclaimed petulantly,
one day, &ldquo;or why come in a carriage at
all?&rdquo; She added: &ldquo;If one came in a flying ship I
would wed him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King made proclamation that whoever
came to the palace in a flying ship should wed
the Princess, and succeed to the kingdom. As
the Princess was very beautiful and the kingdom
very rich, men everywhere began to try to build
ships that would fly. But that was not so easy.
They could build ships that would sail&mdash;but flying
was quite another thing!</p>

<p>On the far edge of the kingdom dwelt a widow
with three sons. The two elder, hearing the proclamation,
said that they wanted to go to the city
and build each a flying ship. So the mother,
who was very proud of these sons, and quite
convinced that should the Princess see one of
them it would not be necessary for him to have
a flying ship, laid out their best clothes and gave
each a satchel containing a lunch of white bread
and jam and fruit, and wished them good luck
on their journeys.</p>

<p>Now the third son was called Simple, because
he did not do as his brothers did, and cared nothing
for fine clothes and fine airs, but liked to
wander off in the woods by himself. When
Simple saw his brothers starting off all so grandly
he said: &ldquo;Give me a lunch, and I will go
and build a flying ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The truth was that the idea of a flying ship
very much appealed to Simple, though he did not
give much thought to the Princess.</p>

<p>But his mother said: &ldquo;Go back into the woods,
Simple, that is the place for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Simple persisted, and at last she gave him
a satchel containing a lunch of black bread without
any jam, and a flask of water.</p>

<p>As Simple neared the woods he met a Manikin
who asked him for something to eat. Simple was
ashamed to open his satchel with the black bread
and water in it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;if one is
hungry black bread is better than no bread.&rdquo; The
Manikin certainly looked hungry, so Simple put
his hand into the satchel and took out the roll of
bread&mdash;and lo&mdash;it was not black at all, but white,
made of the finest flour, and spread with rich,
golden butter. The flask, too, when he took it out,
was not as it had been when his mother put it
in, but was filled with red wine.</p>

<p>So Simple and the Manikin sat down by the
roadside and ate together. Then the Manikin
asked Simple where he was going, and Simple
told him that he was going to build a flying ship.
He almost forgot about the Princess, but remembered,
as an afterthought, and he told the
Manikin that when the ship was done he would
fly in it to the palace and marry the Princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Manikin, &ldquo;if you want to do
that take this ax with you and the first tree that
you come to strike it three times with the ax,
then bow before it three times, and then kneel
down with your face hidden until you are told to
get up. There will be a flying ship before you.
Climb into it and fly to the palace of the Princess,
and if you meet anybody along the way take
them along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Simple took the ax and went into the wood,
and the first tree that he came to he struck three
times with the ax, then bowed three times before
it, then knelt down and hid his face. By-and-by
he felt someone touch his shoulder and he looked
up, and there was a ship with wings outspread,
all ready to fly. So he climbed into it and bade
it fly away to the city of the Princess.</p>

<p>As he flew over a clearing in the woods Simple
saw a man with his ear to the ground, listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you below! What are you
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am listening to the sounds of the world,&rdquo;
said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;come up into the ship.
Maybe you can hear more up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man climbed up into the ship, and they
flew on. As they passed over a field they saw a
man hopping on one leg, with the other strapped
up behind his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Simple, &ldquo;You below! Why do
you hop on one leg, with the other bound up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;if I were to unbind
the other I would step so far that I would be at
the end of the world in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;come up into the ship,
that will be less tiresome than hopping so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man came up into the ship and they
flew on. As they passed a clear lake of cold water
they saw a man standing beside it looking so
disconsolately at the water that Simple called out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ho, you below! Why do you look at the water
so sadly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I am very thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; called Simple, &ldquo;why don&#8217;t you take a
drink? There is water enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;it is not right that I
should drink here, for I am so thirsty that I
would drink all of this at one gulp, and there
would be no lake, and I would still be thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;come up into the ship.
Maybe we can find water enough for you somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man climbed up into the ship and they
flew on. As they passed over a village they met
a man carrying a great basket of bread. &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;
cried Simple, &ldquo;you below! Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to the baker&#8217;s at the other end of
the village to buy some bread for my breakfast,&rdquo;
replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have a big basketful of bread now,&rdquo;
said Simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;that is not enough for the
first morsel. I shall eat that up in one bite.
There are not bakers enough in this village to
keep me supplied, and I am always hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;come up into the ship.
Maybe we shall find some bread in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man climbed up into the ship and they
flew on. As they passed over a meadow they saw
a man carefully carrying a bundle of straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Simple, &ldquo;you below! Why do you
carry that straw so carefully, when there is straw
all about you in the meadow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is no ordinary straw,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;It has a magic power, and when it is scattered
about it will make the hottest place as cold as ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;bring it along and come
up into the ship. It may be hot in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man climbed up into the ship and they
flew on. As they passed over a wooded park
they saw a man carrying a bundle of sticks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Simple, &ldquo;you below! Why do you
carry those sticks so carefully when all the woods
about you are full of sticks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these are not ordinary sticks,&rdquo; said the
man. &ldquo;If I were to throw them on the ground
they would become soldiers, armed and ready for
a battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simple, &ldquo;they are wonderful sticks
indeed! Bring them up into the ship. There may
be a need for soldiers in the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man climbed up into the ship and they
flew on. Soon they came to the city, where the
word soon went about that a ship was flying over,
and men and women came out into the streets and
on to the roofs of the houses to see what it might
be like. And the King came out on his balcony
and saw Simple and his strange crew flying
straight toward the palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;what sort of a
fellow is this? I cannot have him marry my
daughter. He has not a knight in his train&mdash;and
as for him&mdash;!&rdquo; the King had no words in
which to express his thought.</p>

<p>The Princess, too, looking out and seeing the
flying ship with Simple in the bow and the other
strange folk behind him, repented of her rash
word, and said: &ldquo;You must give this fellow
some impossible task to do, so that he will fail,
for it is certain that I cannot wed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King sent for his courtiers, and bade
them wait upon the man in the flying ship and
say to him that before his daughter could be
given in marriage a flask of water must be
brought this day from a spring at the end of
the world.</p>

<p>The man with the wonderful hearing had his
ear to the deck of the ship, and he heard this
order, and reported it to Simple, who lamented,
and said: &ldquo;How can I bring a flask of water
from the end of the world? It may take me a
year to go there and back&mdash;perhaps even the rest
of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man with the bound leg said: &ldquo;You
forget that I am here. When the summons comes
I will take the flask and go for the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when the messenger came Simple answered
quietly that the order would be obeyed at once.</p>

<p>The man with the bound leg unfastened his leg
from behind his ear and started off to the end of
the world, and when he came there he filled the
flask and came back with it, and Simple went with
it to the palace, arriving just as the King and the
Princess were finishing their dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;but we
cannot have this fellow wed the Princess. We
will prepare a feast, and tell him that it must be
eaten at once. Let forty oxen be killed, and five
hundred loaves be prepared and five hundred cakes
be baked, and all of these must this fellow and
his followers eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man with the wonderful hearing having
his ear to the deck of the ship reported this conversation
to Simple, who lamented and said:
&ldquo;How can we eat forty oxen, and five hundred
loaves and five hundred cakes! It will take us a
year to eat so much, or maybe all of the rest of
our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the hungry man, who had long
since eaten the few loaves from his basket, &ldquo;you
forget that I am here. Perhaps now for the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
time in my life I shall have enough to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when the feast was served they all sat down
to it, and ate as they wished; then the hungry man
ate the remainder of the forty oxen and the five
hundred loaves and the five hundred cakes and
there was not a crumb left. When he had quite
finished he said that he could have eaten at least
two more oxen and another hundred cakes, but
that he was not quite so hungry as he had been.</p>

<p>When the King&#8217;s messengers told him that the
feast was all eaten that same night he said:
&ldquo;That is all very well, but we cannot have this
fellow wed the Princess. We will prepare a
drinking, and serve five hundred flagons of wine,
and tell him that it must all be drunken that same
night, or he cannot wed the Princess. Let the
flagons of wine be prepared and served to him,
and all of them must this fellow and his followers
drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man with the wonderful hearing having
his ear to the deck of the ship reported this to
Simple, who lamented and said: &ldquo;How can we
drink five hundred flagons of wine? It will take
us a year to do so, or maybe all of the rest of
our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the thirsty man said, &ldquo;You forget that I
am here. Perhaps now for the first time in my
life I shall have enough to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when the wine was served they all gathered
around the table and drank as much as they
wanted of it; then the thirsty man picked up
flagon after flagon and drank them off until all
were empty. And at the end he said that he
could have drunken at least fifty flagons more,
but that he was not so thirsty as he had been.</p>

<p>When the messengers of the King reported that
the wine was all drunken, the King said: &ldquo;Now
are we put to it, for we cannot have this fellow
wed the Princess.&rdquo; So he sent his messengers
to the ship bidding Simple come to the palace
and make ready for the wedding, and prepared a
bath for him. And when Simple entered the
room for the bath he found that it was heated
so hot that the walls burned his hands when he
touched them, and the floors were like red-hot
iron. But the man with the straw had come in
behind him, warned by the man with the wonderful
hearing, and seeing what was afoot, scattered
his straw all about the bathroom, and at once it
became as cold as one could wish, and, the door
having been locked, Simple climbed up on the
stove and went to sleep, and there they found
him in the morning, wrapped in a blanket.</p>

<p>When this was reported to the King he was
very angry, and he said, &ldquo;This fellow is evidently
very smart, but for all of that we cannot have
him wed the Princess. I will give him an impossible
task. Go you to him,&rdquo; he said to the
messenger, &ldquo;and tell him that he must come to
me at to-morrow&#8217;s sunrise with an army fitting
the rank of one who would wed the Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man with the wonderful hearing reported
this to Simple he was in despair, and
lamented and said: &ldquo;Now at last am I beaten,
though, after all, I have a flying ship, even if I
do not wed the Princess. It will take me a year
to raise an army, perhaps it would take all the
rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man with the sticks said: &ldquo;You forget
that I am here. Now all of these others have
proven that they could help you to win the
Princess, let me at least do my share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So at dawn they flew out over the parade
ground, and the man with the sticks threw them
down upon the ground, and immediately there
sprung up soldiers, in platoons and regiments,
with armor, and captains and colonels and generals
to command them. And the King and his
courtiers had never seen such an army, and the
Princess, standing on the balcony beside her
father, as they rode by the palace, seeing Simple
riding at the head of the band, with the generals
paying him homage, said: &ldquo;This man must be a
very great prince indeed, and, now that I look
at him he is not so uncomely, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Simple, riding at the head of his army,
looking up at the balcony and seeing the Princess
there said to himself: &ldquo;A flying ship is all very
well, but the Princess is very beautiful, and to
wed her will be the most wonderful thing in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Simple and the Princess were married, and
the crew of the flying ship were at the wedding,
and all of the captains and the colonels and the
generals of his army, and never had there been
such a wedding in the kingdom. And by and by
the King died, and Simple became the King, and
the Princess became the Queen, and they lived
happily ever after.</p>

<h2>ROBIN OF THE LOVING HEART</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY EMMA ENDICOTT MAREAN</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Please, Mother, tell us a story. Have him
a wood-chopper boy this time. Please, Mother,
quick, for Elizabeth is sleepy already. Oh,
Mother, hurry!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>So here is the story.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy who
lived all alone with his parents in the heart of a
deep wood. His father was a wood-chopper
who worked hard in the forest all day, while
the mother kept everything tidy at home and
took care of Robin. Robin was an obliging,
sunny-hearted little fellow who chopped the
kindling as sturdily as his father chopped the
dead trees and broken branches, and then he
brought the water and turned the spit for his
mother.</p>

<p>As there were no other children in the great
forest, he made friends with the animals and
learned to understand their talk. In the spring
the mother robin, for whom he thought he was
named, called him to see the blue eggs in her
nest, and in the autumn the squirrels chattered
with him and brought him nuts. But his four
dearest friends were the Owl, who came to his
window evenings and gave him wise counsel;
the Hare, who played hide-and-seek with him
around the bushes; the Eagle, who brought him
strange pebbles and shells from the distant seashore;
and the Lion, who, for friendship&#8217;s sake,
had quite reformed his habits and his appetite,
so that he lapped milk from Robin&#8217;s bowl and
simply adored breakfast foods.</p>

<p>Suddenly all the happiness in the little cottage
was turned to mourning, when the good wood-chopper
was taken ill, and the mother was at her
wits&#8217; end to take care of him and to provide bread
and milk. Robin&#8217;s heart burned within him to
do something to help, but he could not swing an
ax with his little hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said that night to his friend the Owl,
&ldquo;if I were a great knight, perhaps I could ride
to the city and win the Prize for Good Luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the Prize for Good Luck?&rdquo;
asked the Owl, who knew everything in the
world except that.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/img155.jpg" width="247" height="385" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;the owl called a council of robin&#8217;s
best friends&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Then Robin explained that the lovely princess,
whose hair was like spun gold and whose eyes
were like the blue forget-me-nots by the brook,
had lost her precious amulet, given to her by her
godmother, which kept her, as long as it lay on
her neck, healthy and beautiful and happy. One
day, when she was playing in the flower-garden,
the little gold chain snapped and the amulet
rolled away. Everybody in the palace had searched,
the soldiers had been called out to help, and all
the small boys had been organized into an amulet
brigade, for what they cannot see is usually
not worth seeing at all. But no one could find
it, and in the meantime the princess grew pale,
and, truth to tell, rather cross. Her hair dulled
a little, and her eyes looked like forget-me-nots
drowned in the brook. When the court philosopher
reasoned the matter out and discovered
that the amulet had been carried far away, perhaps
outside the kingdom, the king offered the
Prize for Good Luck for its return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if I could win the Prize for Good
Luck,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;we should have bread and
milk all the time, and Mother need not work so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Owl in her wisdom called a council
of Robin&#8217;s best friends, and asked them what
they were going to do about it. They waited
respectfully for her advice; and this was her
wonderful plan:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robin could win the Prize for Good Luck,&rdquo;
declared the Owl, &ldquo;if only he were wise and
swift and clear-sighted and strong enough. Now
I will lend him my wisdom, the Hare shall lend
his swiftness, the Eagle shall
lend his eyesight, and the
Lion shall lend his strength.&rdquo;
And thus it was agreed.</p>

<p>Then the Owl went back
to little Robin&#8217;s window and
explained the plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; she
said warningly, &ldquo;time is
precious. It is almost morning
now. I cannot long spare
my wisdom, for who would
guide the feathered folk? If
the Hare cannot run, how
can he escape the fox? If
the Eagle cannot see, he will
dash himself into the cliff if
he flies, and he will starve to
death if he sits still. If the
Lion&#8217;s strength is gone, the
wolves will be the first to
know it. Return, then, without
delay. At the stroke of
nine o&#8217;clock to-morrow night,
we shall await you here. Now
go quickly, for rather would
I die than live like the
feather-brained blue jay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately Robin felt
himself so strong and so
brave that he hesitated not a
minute. Swift as a hare he
hastened to the palace, and
at daybreak he blew the
mighty horn that announced
the coming of one who would
seek for the amulet. The
king groaned when he saw
him, sure that it would be a vain quest for such a
little fellow. The truth was that the court philosopher
feared the amulet had been stolen by the
Ogre of Ogre Castle, but no one dared to mention
the fact, much less to ask the Ogre to return
it. The princess, however, immediately sat up
and took notice, charmed by the brave light in
Robin&#8217;s eyes and his merry smile.</p>

<p>Robin asked to be taken up into the highest
tower of the palace, and there, looking leagues
and leagues away to Ogre Castle, he saw with
his Eagle sight the amulet, glowing like sunlight
imprisoned in a ruby.</p>

<p>The Ogre was turning it over and over in
his hand, muttering to himself, in the stupid
way ogres always have: &ldquo;It must be a nut, for
I can see something good inside.&rdquo; Robin could
not hear him, but he was sure, by the help of
the Owl&#8217;s wisdom, that it was the amulet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/img156.jpg" width="358" height="449" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;at daybreak robin blew the mighty horn&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>In a thrice&mdash;that means while you count three&mdash;Robin
was speeding away with the Hare&#8217;s swiftness
toward Ogre Castle, and in a few minutes
he was demanding the amulet from the Ogre.</p>

<p>Now usually the Ogre was not at all a disagreeable
fellow, and the Owl&#8217;s wisdom would
have easily sufficed to enable Robin to secure the
amulet without trouble, but he had just tried
to crack the amulet with his teeth. It broke off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the very best tooth he had in his head, and his
poor jaws ached so that he was in a very bad
temper. He turned fiercely, and for a few minutes
Robin needed all the strength the Lion had
given him.</p>

<p>After all, the Ogre was one of the pneumatic-tire,
hot-water-bag kind of giants, who flat out
if you stick a pin into them and lie perfectly
limp until they are bandaged up and set going
once more. That is really a secret, but Robin
knew it by the help of the Owl&#8217;s wisdom, and
he was not the least little bit afraid.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/img157.jpg" width="355" height="461" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;the princess waved her lily hand to robin&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>So Robin managed to get the amulet away
without too much difficulty, and the Hare&#8217;s
swiftness quickly took him back to the palace.
When the princess, who was watching from the
tower window, saw the rosy light of the amulet
in the distance, pinkness came back to her
cheeks, and her eyes shone like stars, and she
waved her lily hand to Robin in perfect happiness.</p>

<p>Ah, such a merrymaking as they planned for
that evening! Robin was to receive the Prize
for Good Luck, so much gold coin that it would
take three carts and six mules to carry it back
to the cottage. The king counted out money
all the afternoon, and the queen put up tarts
and jars of honey for Robin to take to his
mother, and the princess gave him her photograph.</p>

<p>Now comes the sad part. It had taken so
much time to reach the palace, to explain to the
king, to ascend the tower and find the amulet,
to conquer the Ogre of Ogre Castle, and to return
to the palace, that it was almost night
before Robin realized it. When the money had
been counted out and the
tarts wrapped in paraffin paper
and the pots of honey
packed in excelsior, it was
seven o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Now the party was to begin
at nine, for the princess
had to have her white satin
frock sent home from the
dressmaker, and her hair had
to be curled. The Punch and
Judy was to come at ten, and
the ice-cream was to be
served at eleven, for in palaces
people keep terribly late
hours, not at all good for
them. Just as Robin had
dressed himself in a beautiful
blue velvet suit, thinking
how fine it was that he
should open the dance with
the princess and how lucky
it was that he had the
strength of a lion, so that he
could dance at all after his
busy day, he suddenly remembered
his promise to the
Owl.</p>

<p>It was such a shock that, in spite of the Lion&#8217;s
strength, he nearly fainted. Then he went
quickly to the king and told him that he must
go away at once. The king was very angry
and bade him have done with such nonsense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, you must stay,&rdquo; he said crossly.
&ldquo;There would be no living with the princess if
her party is spoiled. Besides, you will lose the
Prize for Good Luck, for the people have been
promised that they shall see it presented to somebody
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to-night and we must not disappoint them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/img158a.jpg" width="245" height="325" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;the saucy blue jay mocked the fluttering owl&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Poor Robin&#8217;s heart was heavy. How could he
lose all that he had gained and go away as poor
as when he came? That wasn&#8217;t all nor half of
all. To lose the money would be bad, but he
had much more to lose than that. For one day
he had enjoyed the fun of being stronger and
wiser and swifter and keener-sighted than anybody
else. Isn&#8217;t that better than money and all
the prizes for good luck? Yes, indeed, his heart
answered over and over again. How could he
go back and give up the wisdom and the swiftness
and the clear sight and the strength, even
if he could give up the money?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; he thought bitterly, &ldquo;how the
Owl felt when she said she would not be a feather-brain
like the blue jay. And it is much more
important for a boy to be strong than for a common
old lion, who is pretty old anyway. And
there are lots of hares in the forest and eagles
on the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Robin slowly climbed the stairs to the
tower, for he thought he would see what the
Owl and the Hare and the Eagle and the Lion
were doing in the forest. He looked over to
the cottage, leagues and leagues away. There,
under a big oak, lay the Owl, her feathers all
a-flutter. She had had no more sense than to
go out in the brilliant sunshine, and something
had gone wrong inside her head. The saucy
blue jay stood back and mocked her. Robin&#8217;s
heart gave one little throb of pity, but he was
wise enough to see the value of wisdom, and he
hardened himself. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t believe she has sense
enough to know that anything is wrong,&rdquo; he
said to himself.</p>

<p>Then he looked for the Hare. &ldquo;Oh, he&#8217;s all
right,&rdquo; said Robin, gladly. But just then he
saw a dark shape, only about a mile away, following
the Hare&#8217;s track.</p>

<p>Robin&#8217;s heart gave two throbs of pity. &ldquo;Poor
old Hare!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have had lots of fun
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he looked for the Eagle, and his heart
beat hard and fast when he saw him sitting
alone on the dead branch of a tree, one wing
hanging bruised, perhaps broken, and his sightless
eyes turned toward the tower, waiting, waiting.
Blind!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/img158b.jpg" width="246" height="274" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;it followed the hare&#8217;s track&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Robin looked quickly for the Lion. For a
time he could not find him, for tears came in his
eyes as he thought of the Eagle. Then he saw
the poor creature, panting from thirst, trying
to drag himself to the river. He was almost
there when his last bit of strength seemed to
fail, and he lay still, with the water only a few
yards away.</p>

<p>Then Robin&#8217;s heart leaped and bounded with
pity, and with pure gladness, too, that he was
not yet too late to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
save his friends from the consequences
of their own generosity. The
last rays of sunset struck the tower as
Robin, forgetting all about his blue
velvet clothes and the princess and
the Prize for Good Luck, ran and raced,
uphill and down, through brambles
and briers, over bogs and hummocks,
leaving bits of lace caught on the
bushes, swifter than ever he hastened to
the Ogre of Ogre Castle or to the lovely princess
with the amulet.</p>

<img src="images/img159as.jpg" width="136" height="365" alt="He saw the blind eagle sitting alone in the tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>He was there&mdash;oh, yes, he was
there long before nine o&#8217;clock. The
Owl received back her wisdom, and I can
tell you that she soon sent the saucy blue jay
packing. The Hare had his swiftness, and the
fox was left so far behind that he was soon glad
to limp back home and eat the plain supper that
Mrs. Fox had prepared for him. The poor blind
Eagle opened his eyes, and saw the moon and the
stars, and, better than moon and stars, the loving
face of his comrade, Robin. The Lion drank his
fill, and said that now he would like some breakfast
food, please. So the story ended happily
after all.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I forgot about the Prize for Good
Luck, didn&#8217;t I? When the king told the princess
that Robin was foolish enough to give back
the wisdom and the swiftness and the clear sight
and the strength that had won the prize for him,
and that without them he was only a very common
little boy, not good enough for a princess
to dance with, she stamped her foot and called
for the godmother who gave her the amulet in
the first place.</p>

<p>Then the princess&#8217;s godmother said that the
princess for once was quite, quite right&mdash;that
Robin must have the three cartloads of gold
coin drawn by six mules, and the tarts and
honey for his mother, and whenever the princess
gave another party she must ask him to
open the dance with her, blue velvet suit or no
blue velvet suit&mdash;&ldquo;because,&rdquo; said the godmother,
&ldquo;there is one thing better than wisdom or swiftness
or clear sight or strength, and that is a
loving heart.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN</h2>


<p>Hundreds of thousands of years ago a prince
met a fair maiden as he traveled through the Enchanted
Land. The prince loved the maiden
dearly, and she loved him as much as he loved
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; asked the prince one
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;for there is
no one in all the world I love so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all was as merry as merry could be. The
maiden danced and sang, and the prince laughed
aloud for joy.</p>

<p>But one day, as they were together, a messenger
arrived hot and breathless. He came from
the prince&#8217;s father, who was King of a neighboring
kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Majesty is dying,&rdquo; said the messenger,
&ldquo;and he would speak with you, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said the prince to the maiden, &ldquo;I must
leave you, and remain with my father until his
death. Then I shall be king and I will come for
you and you shall be my queen. Till then,
good-by. This ring I give you as a keepsake.
Once more, farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden drew the ring on her finger, and,
with a sad heart, watched the prince ride off.</p>

<p>The King had but a short time to live when
his son arrived at the palace. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the dying
man, &ldquo;how glad I am that you are come.
There is one promise I wish you to make ere I
die. Then I shall close my eyes in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, dear father, I will promise what you
ask. There is nothing I would not do to let you
rest at ease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then said the dying King, &ldquo;Promise that you
will marry the bride whom I have chosen for
you,&rdquo; and he named a princess well known to
the prince.</p>

<p>Without thinking of anything but to ease his
father&#8217;s mind, the prince said, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; The
King smiled gladly as he heard the words, and
closed his eyes in peace.</p>

<p>The prince was now proclaimed King, and the
time soon came when he must go to the bride his
father had chosen for him, and ask, &ldquo;Will you
marry me?&rdquo; This he did, and the princess answered,
&ldquo;Indeed I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the maiden who had first promised to
marry the prince heard of this, and it nearly
broke her heart. Each day she grew paler and
thinner, until her father at last said: &ldquo;Wherefore,
my child, do you look so sad? Ask what you will,
and I shall do my utmost to give it you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment his daughter thought. Then
she said: &ldquo;Dear father, find for me eleven maidens
exactly like myself. Let them be fair, and
tall, and slim, with curly golden hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall do my best,&rdquo; said her father; and he
had a search made far and wide throughout the
Enchanted Land until the eleven maidens were
found. Each was fair, and tall, and slim, and
there was not one whose golden hair did not curl.</p>

<p>The maiden was pleased indeed, and she next
ordered twelve huntsmen&#8217;s dresses to be made of
green cloth, trimmed with beaver fur; also
twelve green caps each with a pheasant&#8217;s feather.
Then to each of the maidens she gave a dress and
hat, commanding her to wear them, while the
twelfth she wore herself.</p>

<p>The twelve huntsmen then set out on horseback
to the court of the King, who, when a prince, had
promised to marry their leader.</p>

<p>So well was the maiden disguised by the hunting-dress,
that the King did not recognize her.
She asked if he were in need of huntsmen, and
if he would take her and her companions into his
service.</p>

<p>Never had a finer troop been seen, and the
King said he would gladly engage them. So they
entered his service, and lived at the palace, and
were treated with all kindness and respect.</p>

<p>Now among the King&#8217;s favorites at court was
a lion. To possess this lion was as good
as to have a magician, for he knew all secret
things.</p>

<p>One evening the lion said to the King: &ldquo;You
imagine you engaged twelve young huntsmen not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
long ago, do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me, if I contradict you,&rdquo; said
the lion, &ldquo;but I assure you, you are mistaken.
They were not huntsmen whom you engaged, but
twelve maidens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;absurd, ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again I would crave forgiveness if I offend,&rdquo;
said the lion, &ldquo;but those whom you believe to be
huntsmen are, in truth, twelve fair maidens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prove what you say, if you would have me
believe it,&rdquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then, summon the twelve to the
royal chamber. On the floor let peas be scattered.
Then, as the huntsmen advance toward you, you
will see them trip and slide as maidens. If they
are men they will walk with a firm tread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most wise Lion!&rdquo; said the King, and he ordered
it to be done as the royal beast had said.</p>

<p>But in the palace was a servant who already
loved the fair young huntsmen, and when he
heard of the trap that was to be laid, he went
straight to them and said, &ldquo;The lion is going to
prove to the King that you are maidens.&rdquo; Then
he told them how he would seek to do this,
and said, &ldquo;Do your best to walk with a firm
tread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning the King ordered the twelve
huntsmen to be called, and as they walked across
the royal chamber, it was with so firm a tread
that not a single pea moved.</p>

<p>After they had left, the King turned to the
lion and said, &ldquo;You have spoken falsely. They
walked as other men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the lion said: &ldquo;They must have been
warned, or they would have tripped and slidden
as maidens. I will yet prove to you that I speak
the truth. To-morrow, summon the twelve to the
royal chamber. Let twelve spinning-wheels be
placed there. Then, as the huntsmen advance
toward you, you will see each cast longing looks
at the spinning-wheels, which, if they were men,
you must grant they would not do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King was pleased that the huntsmen should
again be put to the test, for the lion was a wise
beast and had never before been proved wrong.</p>

<p>But again the kind servant warned the disguised
maidens, and they resolved not even to
glance in the direction of the spinning-wheels.</p>

<p>Next morning the King ordered the twelve
huntsmen to be called, and as they walked across
the royal chamber there was not one of them but
looked straight into the eyes of the King. It
seemed as though they had not known that the
spinning-wheels were there.</p>

<p>After they had gone the King turned to the
lion, and again he said, &ldquo;You have spoken
falsely.&rdquo; Then he told the royal beast that the
twelve huntsmen had not even glanced in the direction
of the spinning-wheels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must have been warned,&rdquo; repeated the
lion, but the King believed him no longer.</p>

<p>So the huntsmen stayed with the King and
went out a-hunting with him, and the more he
saw of them the more he liked them.</p>

<p>One day, while they were in the forest, news
was brought that the princess whom the King was
to marry was on her way to meet the hunting-party.</p>

<p>When the true bride heard it, she grew white as
a lily, and, staggering, fell backward. Fortunately,
the trunk of a tree supported her until the
King, wondering what had happened to his dear
huntsman, ran to the spot and pulled off her
glove.</p>

<p>Looking at the white hand, what was his surprise
to see upon the middle finger the ring he
had given to the maiden he loved. Then he
looked into her face and recognized her, and in a
flash he understood that she had come to court as
a huntsman, only to be near him. The King was
so touched that he kissed her white cheeks till
they grew rosy, and her blue eyes opened in wonder.
&ldquo;You shall be my queen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
none in all the wide world shall separate us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he sent a messenger to the princess who
was coming to meet him, saying he was sorry he
must ask her to return home, as the maiden that
he loved and was going to marry was with him
in the forest.</p>

<p>And the next day the bells pealed loud and far,
and at the royal wedding the lion was an honored
guest, because it had at last been proved that he
spoke the truth.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="DANCING" id="DANCING"></a>THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had
twelve daughters, each more beautiful than the
other. The twelve princesses slept in a large hall,
each in a little bed of her own. After they were
snugly settled for the night, their father, the
King, used to bolt the door on the outside. He
then felt sure that his daughters would be safe
until he withdrew the bolt next morning.</p>

<p>But one day when the King unbolted the hall
door, and peeped in as usual, he saw twelve
worn-out pairs of little slippers lying about the
floor.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What! shoes wanted again,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
after breakfast a messenger was sent to order a
new pair for each of the princesses.</p>

<p>But the next morning the new shoes were worn
out, how no one knew.</p>

<p>This went on and on until the King made up
his mind to put an end to the mystery. The shoes,
he felt sure, were danced to pieces, and he sent
a herald to offer a reward to any one who should
discover where the princesses held their night-frolic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who succeeds, shall choose one of my
daughters to be his wife,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and he
shall reign after my death; but he who fails, after
three nights&#8217; trial, shall be put to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon a prince arrived at the palace, and said
he was willing to risk his life in the attempt to
win one of the beautiful princesses.</p>

<p>When night came, he was given a bedroom next
the hall in which the royal sisters slept. His door
was left ajar and his bed placed so that from it
he could watch the door of the hall. The escape
of the princesses he would also watch, and he
would follow them in their flight, discover their
secret haunt, and marry the fairest.</p>

<p>This is what the prince meant to do, but before
long he was fast asleep. And while he slept, the
princesses danced and danced, for, in the morning,
the soles of their slippers were once more
riddled with holes.</p>

<p>The next night the prince made up his mind
that stay awake he would, but again he must have
fallen fast asleep, for in the morning twelve pairs
of little worn-out slippers lay scattered about the
floor of the hall.</p>

<p>The third night, in fear and trembling, the
prince began his night watch. But try as he
might, he could not keep his eyes open, and when
in the morning the little slippers were as usual
found riddled with holes, the King had no mercy
on the prince who could not keep awake, and his
head was at once cut off.</p>

<p>After his death, many princes came from far
and near, each willing to risk everything in the
attempt to win the fairest of these fair princesses.
But each failed, and each in his turn was beheaded.</p>

<p>Now a poor soldier, who had been wounded in
the wars, was on his way home to the town where
the twelve princesses lived. One morning he met
an old witch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can no longer serve your country,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your help, good mother, I mean to rule
it,&rdquo; replied the soldier; for he had heard of the
mystery at the palace, and of the reward the King
offered to him who should solve it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That need not be difficult,&rdquo; said the witch.
&ldquo;Listen to me. Go straightway to the palace.
There you will be led before the throne. Tell the
King that you would win the fairest of his fair
daughters for your wife. His Majesty will welcome
you gladly, and when night falls, you will be
shown to a little bedroom. From the time you
enter it, remember these three things. Firstly, refuse
to drink the wine which will be offered you;
secondly, pretend to fall fast asleep; thirdly, wear
this when you wish to be invisible.&rdquo; So saying,
the old dame gave him a cloak and disappeared.</p>

<p>Straightway, the soldier went to the palace, and
was led before the throne. &ldquo;I would win the
fairest of your fair daughters for my wife,&rdquo; said
he, bowing low before the King.</p>

<p>So anxious was his Majesty to discover the
secret haunt of his daughters, that he gladly welcomed
the poor soldier, and ordered that he should
be dressed in scarlet and gold.</p>

<p>When bedtime came, the soldier was shown his
little room, from which he could see the door of
the sleeping-hall. No sooner had he been left
alone than in glided a fair princess bearing in her
hand a silver goblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bring you sweet wine. Drink,&rdquo; she said.
The soldier took the cup and pretended to swallow,
but he really let the wine trickle down into
a sponge which he had fastened beneath his chin.</p>

<p>The princess then left him, and he went to bed
and pretended to fall asleep. So well did he pretend,
that before long his snores were heard by
the princesses in their sleeping-hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the eldest, and they all sat up in
bed and laughed and laughed till the room shook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever we were safe, we are safe to-night,&rdquo;
they thought, as they sprang from their little
white beds, and ran to and fro, opening cupboards,
boxes, and cases, and taking from them
dainty dresses, and ribbons, and laces and jewels.</p>

<p>Gaily they decked themselves before the mirror,
bubbling over with mischief and merriment at
the thought that once more they should enjoy
their night-frolic. Only the youngest sister was
quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I feel
so strange&mdash;as if something were going to
happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a little goose,&rdquo; answered the eldest,
&ldquo;you are always afraid. Why! I need not have
put a sleeping powder in the soldier&#8217;s wine. He
would have slept without it. Now, are you all
ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The twelve princesses then stood on tiptoe at
the hall door, and peered into the little room
where the soldier lay, seemingly sound asleep.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Yes, they were quite safe once more.</p>

<p>Back they went into the hall. The eldest
princess tapped upon her bed. Immediately it
sank into the earth, and, through the opening it
had made, the princesses went down one by one.</p>

<p>The soldier who, peeping, had seen twelve little
heads peer out of the hall door, at once threw his
invisible cloak around him, and followed the
princesses into the hall, unseen. He was just in
time to reach the youngest, as she disappeared
through the opening in the floor. Halfway down
he trod upon her frock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what was that?&rdquo; screamed the little
princess, terrified. &ldquo;Some one is tramping on my
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, be quiet,&rdquo; said the eldest, &ldquo;it must
have caught on a hook.&rdquo; Then they all went
down, down, until they reached a beautiful avenue
of silver trees.</p>

<p>Thought the soldier, &ldquo;I must take away a remembrance
of the place to show the King,&rdquo; and
he broke off a twig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you hear that crackling sound?&rdquo; cried
the youngest princess. &ldquo;I told you something was
going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo; replied the eldest. &ldquo;The sound was a
salute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next they came to an avenue where the trees
were golden. Here the soldier again broke off a
twig, and again was heard the crackling sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A salute, I told you,&rdquo; said the eldest princess
to her terrified little sister.</p>

<p>Further on they reached an avenue of trees
that glittered with diamonds. When the soldier
once more broke off a twig, the youngest princess
screamed with fright, but her sisters only went on
faster and faster, and she had to follow in fear
and trembling.</p>

<p>At last they came to a great lake. Close to the
shore lay twelve little boats, and in each boat
stood a handsome prince, one hand upon an oar,
the other outstretched to welcome a princess.</p>

<p>Soon the little boats rowed off, a prince and a
princess in each, the soldier, still wearing his invisible
cloak, sitting by the youngest sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the prince who rowed her,
&ldquo;why the boat is so heavy to-day. I have to pull
with all my strength, and yet can hardly get
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I do not know,&rdquo; answered the
princess. &ldquo;I dare say it is the hot weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the opposite shore of the lake stood a castle.
Its bright lights beckoned to the twelve little boats
that rowed toward it. Drums beat, and trumpets
sounded a welcome. Very merrily did the sisters
reach the little pier. They sprang from the boats,
and ran up the castle steps and into the gay ballroom.
And there they danced and danced, but
never saw or guessed that the soldier with the
invisible cloak danced among them. When a
princess lifted a wine-cup to her lips and found
it empty, she felt frightened, but she little thought
that the unseen soldier had drained it. On and
on they danced, until three o&#8217;clock, but then the
sisters had to stop, for all their little slippers were
riddled with holes. And in the early gray morning
the princes rowed them back across the lake,
while the soldier seated himself this time beside
the eldest princess.</p>

<p>When they reached the bank, the sisters wandered
up the sloping shore, while the princes
called after them, &ldquo;Good-by, fair daughters of the
King, to-night once more shall we await you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the princesses turned, and, waving their
white hands, cried sleepily, &ldquo;Farewell, farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little did the sisters dream as they loitered
homeward, that the soldier ran past them, reached
the castle, and climbed the staircase that led to his
little bedroom. When, slowly and wearily, they
reached the door of the hall where they slept,
they heard loud snores coming from his room.
&ldquo;Ah, safe once more!&rdquo; they exclaimed, and they
undid their silk gowns, and their ribbons and
jewels, and kicked off their little worn-out shoes.
Then each went to her white bed, and in less than
a minute was sound asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the soldier told nothing of
his wonderful adventure, for he thought he would
like again to follow the princesses in their wanderings.
And this he did a second and a third
time, and each night the twelve sisters danced
until their slippers were riddled with holes. The
third night the soldier carried off a goblet, as
a sign that he had visited the castle across the
lake.</p>

<p>When next day he was brought before the
King, to tell where the twelve dancing princesses
held their night-frolic, the soldier took with him
the twig with its silver leaves, the twig with its
leaves of gold, and the twig whose leaves were
of diamonds. He took, too, the goblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would live, young man,&rdquo; said the King,
&ldquo;answer me this: How comes it that my daughters&#8217;
slippers, morning after morning are danced
into holes? Tell me, where have the princesses
spent the three last nights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With twelve princes in an underground castle,&rdquo;
was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>And when the soldier told his story, and held
up the three twigs and the goblet to prove the
truth of what he said, the King sent for his
daughters.</p>

<p>In the twelve sisters tripped, with no pity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
in their hearts for &ldquo;the old snorer,&rdquo; as
they called the soldier; but when their eyes
fell upon the twigs and the goblet they all
turned white as lilies, for they knew that their
secret night-frolics were now at an end for
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell your tale,&rdquo; said the King to the soldier.
But before he could speak, the princesses wrung
their hands, crying, &ldquo;Alack! alack!&rdquo; and their
father knew that at last he had discovered their
secret.</p>

<p>Then turning to the soldier, the King said:
&ldquo;You have indeed won your prize. Which of my
daughters do you choose as your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no longer young,&rdquo; replied the soldier.
&ldquo;Let me marry the eldest princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that very day the wedding bells pealed loud
and far, and a few years later the old soldier and
his bride were proclaimed King and Queen.</p>

<h2><a name="EDWY" id="EDWY"></a>EDWY AND THE ECHO</h2>


<p>It was in the time of good Queen Anne, when
none of the trees in the great forest of Norwood,
near London, had begun to be cut down, that a
very rich gentleman and lady lived in that neighborhood.
Their name was Lawley, and they had
a fine old house and large garden with a wall all
round it. The woods were so close to this garden
that some of the high trees spread their branches
over the top of the wall.</p>

<p>Now this lady and gentleman were very proud
and very grand. They despised all people poorer
than themselves, and there were none whom they
despised more than the gypsies, who lived in the
forest round about them.</p>

<p>There was no place in all England then so full
of gypsies as the forest of Norwood.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lawley had been married many
years without having children. At length they
had a son, whom they called Edwy. They could
not make enough of their only child or dress him
too finely.</p>

<p>When he was just old enough to run about
without help, he used to wear his trousers inlaid
with the finest lace, with golden studs and laced
robings. He had a plume of feathers in his cap,
which was of velvet, with a button of gold to
fasten it up in front under the feathers. He
looked so fine that whoever saw him with the servants
who attended him used to say, &ldquo;Whose
child is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a pretty boy, too, and when his first
sorrow came he was still too young to have
learned any proud ways.</p>

<p>No one is so rich as to be above the reach of
trouble, and when at last it came to Mr. and Mrs.
Lawley it was all the more terrible.</p>

<p>One day the proud parents had been away some
hours visiting a friend a few miles distant. On
their return Edwy was nowhere to be found. His
waiting-maid was gone, and had taken away his
finest clothes. At least, these also were missing.</p>

<p>The poor father and mother were almost beside
themselves with grief. All the gentlemen and
magistrates round about helped in the search and
tried to discover who had stolen him. But it was
all in vain. Of course the gypsies were suspected
and well examined, but nothing could be made of
it.</p>

<p>Nor was it ever found out how the child had
been carried off. But carried off he had been by
the gypsies, and taken away to a country among
hills between Worcester and Hereford.</p>

<p>In that country was a valley with a river running
deep at the bottom. There were many trees
and bushes, rocks and caves and holes there. Indeed,
it was the best possible place for the haunt
of wild people.</p>

<p>To this place the gypsies carried the little
boy, and there they kept him all the following
winter, warm in a hut with some of their own
children.</p>

<p>They stripped him of his velvet and feathers
and lace and golden clasps and studs, and clothed
him in rags and daubed his fair skin with mud.
But they fed him well, and after a little while
he was quite happy and contented.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cunning gypsies hoped that during
the long months of winter the child would quite
forget the few words he had learned to speak distinctly
in his father&#8217;s house. They thought he
would forget to call himself Edwy, or to cry,
&ldquo;Oh, mamma, mamma, papa, papa! come to little
Edwy!&rdquo; as he so often did. They taught him
that his name was not Edwy, but Jack, or Tom,
or some such name. And they made him say
&ldquo;mam&rdquo; and &ldquo;dad&rdquo; and call himself the gypsy boy,
born in a barn.</p>

<p>But after he had learned all these words, whenever
anything hurt or frightened him, he would
cry again, &ldquo;Mamma, papa, come to Edwy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gypsies could not take him out with them
while there was a danger of his crying like that.
So he never went with them on their rounds of
begging and buying rags and telling fortunes.
Instead, he was left in the hut, in the valley, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
some big girl or old woman to look after him.</p>

<p>It happened one day, in the month of May, that
Edwy was left as usual in the hut. He had been
up before sunrise to breakfast with those who
were going out for their day&#8217;s begging and stealing.
After they had left, he had fallen asleep on
a bed of dry leaves. Only one old woman, who
was too lame to tramp, was left with him.</p>

<p>He slept long, and when he awoke he sat up on
his bed of leaves and looked about him to see who
was with him. He saw no one within the hut,
and no one at the doorway.</p>

<p>Little children do not like to be quite alone.
Edwy listened to hear if there were any voices
outside, but he heard nothing but the rush of
a waterfall close by, and the distant cry of
sheep and lambs. The next thing the little one
did was to get up and go out at the door of
the hut.</p>

<p>The hut was built of rude rafters in the front
of a cave or hole in the rock. It was low down
in the glen, at the edge of the brook, a little below
the waterfall. When the child came out he
looked anxiously for somebody, and was more
and more frightened when he could find no one
at all.</p>

<p>The old woman must have been close at hand
although out of sight, but she was deaf, and did
not hear the noise made by the child when he
came out of the hut.</p>

<p>Edwy did not remember how long he stood by
the brook, but this is certain, that the longer he
felt himself to be alone the more frightened he
became. Then he began to fancy terrible things.
At the top of the rock from which the waters fell
there was a huge old yew-tree, or rather bush,
which hung forward over the fall. It looked
very black in comparison with the tender green
of the other trees, and the white, glittering spray
of the water.</p>

<p>Edwy looked at it and fancied that it moved.
His eye was deceived by the dancing motion of
the water. While he looked and looked, some
great black bird came out from the midst of it,
uttering a harsh, croaking sound.</p>

<p>The little boy could bear no more. He turned
away from the terrible bush and the terrible bird,
and ran down the valley, leaving hut and all behind.
And, as he ran, he cried, as he always did
when hurt or frightened, &ldquo;Papa, mamma! oh,
come! oh, come to Edwy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran and ran while his little bare feet were
bruised with pebbles, and his legs torn with briers.
Very soon he came to where the valley became
narrower and the rocks and banks higher on
either side. The brook ran along between, and a
path went in a line with the brook; but this path
was only used by the gypsies and a few poor cottagers,
and was but a lonely road.</p>

<p>As Edwy ran he still cried, &ldquo;Mamma, mamma,
papa, papa! oh, come! oh, come to Edwy!&rdquo; And
he kept up this cry from time to time, till his
young voice began to be returned in a sort of hollow
murmur.</p>

<p>When first he noticed this, he was even more
frightened than before. He stood and looked
round. Then he turned with his back toward the
hut and ran and ran again until he got deeper in
among the rocks. Then he stopped again, for the
high black banks frightened him still more, and
setting up his young voice he called again as he
had done before.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished his cry, when a voice
seemed to answer him. It said, &ldquo;Come, come to
Edwy!&rdquo; It said it once, it said it twice, it said
it a third time. But it seemed each time more
distant.</p>

<p>The child looked up and down, and all around,
and in his terror he cried more loudly, &ldquo;Oh, papa,
mamma! come, come to poor Edwy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an echo, the echo of the rocks which
repeated the words of the child. The more loudly
he spoke, the more perfect was the echo. But he
could only catch the last few words, and this time
he only heard, &ldquo;Poor, poor Edwy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edwy still dimly remembered a far-away happy
home, and kind parents, and now he believed that
what the echo said came from them. They were
calling to him, and saying, &ldquo;Poor, poor Edwy!&rdquo;
But where could they be? Were they in the
caves, or at the top of the rocks, or in the blue
bright heavens?</p>

<p>He looked at the rocks and the sky, and down
among the reeds and sedges and alders by the
side of the brook, but he could find no one.</p>

<p>After a while he called again, and called louder
still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; was the cry again, &ldquo;Edwy is
lost! lost! lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Echo repeated the last words as before, &ldquo;Lost!
lost! lost!&rdquo; and now the voice sounded from behind
him, for he had moved round a corner of a
rock.</p>

<p>The child heard the voice behind, and turned
and ran that way. Then he stopped and heard it
again in the opposite direction. Next he
shrieked from fear, and echo returned the shriek,
finishing up with broken sounds which to Edwy&#8217;s
ears seemed as if some one a long way off was
mocking him. His terror was now at its highest,
and he did not know what to do, or where to go.
Turning round, he began once more to run down
the valley, and every step took him nearer the
mouth of the glen and the entrance to the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
highroad.</p>

<p>And who had been driving along that road, in
a fine carriage with four horses, but Edwy&#8217;s own
papa and mamma!</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lawley had given up all hopes of
finding their little boy near Norwood, and they
had set out in their coach to go all over the country
in search of him. They had come the day before
to a town near to the place where the
gypsies had kept Edwy all the winter. There
they had made many inquiries, and asked about
the gypsies who were to be found in that country.
But people were afraid of the gypsies, and
did not like to say anything which might bring
trouble upon themselves.</p>

<p>The poor father and mother, therefore, could
get no news there, and the next morning they
came across the country, and along the road into
which the gypsies&#8217; valley opened.</p>

<p>Wherever these unhappy parents saw a wild
country full of woods, they thought, if possible,
more than ever of their lost child, and Mrs. Lawley
would begin to weep. Indeed, she had done
little else since she lost her boy.</p>

<p>The travelers first caught sight of the gypsies&#8217;
valley as the coach arrived at the top of a high
hill. The descent on the other side was so steep
that it was thought right to put a drag on the
wheels.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawley suggested that they should get out
and walk down the hill, so the coach stopped and
every one got down from it. Mr. Lawley walked
first, followed closely by his servant William,
and Mrs. Lawley came after, leaning on the arm
of her favorite little maid Barbara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Barbara!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lawley, when the
others were gone forward, &ldquo;when I remember
all the pretty ways of my boy, and think of his
lovely face and gentle temper, and of the way in
which I lost him, my heart is ready to break.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear mistress,&rdquo; answered the little maid,
&ldquo;who knows but that our grief may soon be at
an end and we may find him yet and all will be
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lawley walked on before with the servant.
He too was thinking of his boy as he looked up
the wild lonely valley. He saw a raven rise from
the wood and heard its croaking noise&mdash;it was
perhaps the same black bird that had frightened
Edwy.</p>

<p>William remarked to his master that there was
a sound of falling water and that there must be
brooks running into the valley. Mr. Lawley, however,
was too sad to talk to his servant. He could
only say, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&rdquo; and then they both
walked on in silence.</p>

<p>They came to the bottom of the valley even
before the carriage got there. They found that
the brook crossed the road in that place, and that
the road was carried over it by a little stone
bridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawley stopped upon the bridge. He
leaned on the low wall, and looked upon the dark
mouth of the glen, William stood a little behind
him.</p>

<p>William was young, and his sense of hearing
was very quick. As he stood there he thought he
heard a voice, but the rattling of the coach-wheels
over the stony road prevented his hearing
it distinctly. He heard the cry again, but the
coach was coming nearer, and made it still more
difficult for him to catch the sound.</p>

<p>His master was surprised the next moment
to see him jump over the low parapet of the
bridge and run up the narrow path which led
to the glen.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Edwy and the answering
echo which William had heard. He had got just
far enough away from the sound of the coach-wheels
at the moment when the echo returned
poor little Edwy&#8217;s wildest shriek.</p>

<p>The sound was fearful and unnatural, but
William was not easily put out. He looked back
to his master, and his look made Mr. Lawley at
once leave the bridge and follow him, though
hardly knowing why.</p>

<p>They both went up the glen, the man being some
way in front of his master. Another cry and another
answering echo again reached the ear of
William. The young man once more looked
round at his master and ran on. The last cry
had been heard by Mr. Lawley, who followed as
quickly as he could. But, as the valley turned
and turned among the rocks, he soon lost sight of
his servant.</p>

<p>Very soon Mr. Lawley came to the very place
where the echo had most astonished Edwy, because
the sound had seemed to come from opposite
sides. Here he heard the cry again, and
heard it distinctly. It was the voice of a child
crying, &ldquo;No! no! no! papa! mamma! Oh, come!
oh, come!&rdquo; and then a fearful shriek or laugh of
some wild woman&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawley rushed on, winding in and out between
the rocks. Different voices, all repeated
in strange confusion by the echoes, rang in his
ears. But amid all these sounds he thought only
of that one sad cry, &ldquo;Papa! mamma! Oh, come!
oh, come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he came out to where he saw his servant
again, and with him an old woman who
looked like a witch. She held the hand of a little
ragged child very firmly, though the baby struggled
hard to get free, crying, &ldquo;Papa! mamma!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Oh, come! oh, come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>William was talking earnestly to the woman,
and had got hold of the other hand of the child.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawley rushed on, trembling with hope
and fear. Could this boy be his Edwy? William
had entered his service since he had lost his child
and could not therefore know the boy. He himself
could not be sure&mdash;so strange, so altered did
the baby look.</p>

<p>But Edwy knew his own papa in a moment.
He could not run to meet him, for he was tightly
held by the gypsy, but he cried, &ldquo;Oh, papa! papa
is come to Edwy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman knew Mr. Lawley, and saw
that the child knew him. She had been trying to
persuade William that the boy was her grandchild.
But it was no use now. She let the child&#8217;s
hand go, and, while he was flying to his father&#8217;s
arms, she disappeared into some well-known hole
or hollow in the neighboring rocks.</p>

<p>Who can describe the feelings of the father
when he felt the arms of his long-lost boy clinging
round his neck, and the little heart beating
against his own? Or who could say what the
mother felt when she saw her husband come out
from the mouth of the valley, bearing in his arms
the little ragged child? Could this be her own
baby, her Edwy? She could hardly be sure of
her happiness till the boy held out his arms to
her and cried, &ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before they got into the coach the happy parents
knelt down upon the grass to thank God for
his goodness. There was no pride now in their
hearts and they never forgot the lesson they had
learned.</p>

<p>In their beautiful home at Norwood they were
soon as much loved and respected as they had
been feared and disliked. Even the gypsies in
time became their faithful friends, and Edwy was
as safe in the forest as in his own garden at
home.</p>

<h2><a name="VINEGAR" id="VINEGAR"></a>THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO<br />
LIVED IN A VINEGAR-BOTTLE</h2>


<p>There was once upon a time a little old woman
who lived in a vinegar-bottle. One day, as she
was sweeping out her house, she found a silver
coin, and she thought she should like to buy a fish.</p>

<p>So off she went to the place where the fishermen
were casting their nets. When she got there
the nets had just been drawn up, and there was
only one little fish in them. So the fishermen let
her have that for her silver piece.</p>

<p>But, as she was carrying it home, the little fish
opened its mouth and said: &ldquo;Pray, good woman,
throw me into the water again. I am but a very
little fish, and I shall make you a very poor supper.
Pray, good woman, throw me into the water
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman had pity on the little
fish, and threw it into the water.</p>

<p>But hardly had she done so before the water
began to bubble and a little fairy stood beside her.
&ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am the little fish
you threw into the water, and, as you were so
kind to me when I was in trouble, I promise to
give you anything that you wish for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the little old woman thanked the fairy
very much, but said she did not want for anything.
She lived in a nice little vinegar-bottle
with a ladder to go up and down, and had all she
wished for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;if at any time you
want anything, you have only to come to the
waterside and call &lsquo;Fairy, fairy,&rsquo; and I shall appear,
to answer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and she
lay awake all night trying to think of something
she wanted. And the next morning she went to
the waterside and called &ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the
water bubbled, and the little fairy stood beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, good woman?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You were
so kind, ma&#8217;am, as to promise that you would
give me anything I wished for, because I threw
you into the water when you were but a little fish.
Now, if you please, ma&#8217;am, I should like a little
cottage. For you must know I live in a vinegar-bottle,
and I find it very tiresome to have to go
up and down a ladder every time I go in and out
of my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home and you shall have one,&rdquo; said the
fairy.</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she found a nice whitewashed cottage, with roses
climbing round the windows.</p>

<p>She was very happy, and thought she would
never want anything more; but after a while she
grew discontented again.</p>

<p>So back she went to the waterside and called
&ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the water bubbled, and the
little fairy stood beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, good woman?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house, and
now, if you please, ma&#8217;am, I would like some new
furniture. For the furniture I had in the vinegar-bottle
looks very shabby now that it is in
the pretty little cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home and you shall have some,&rdquo; said the
fairy.</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she found her cottage filled with nice new furniture,
a stool and table, a neat little four-post
bed with blue-and-white checked curtains, and an
armchair covered with flowered chintz.</p>

<p>She was very happy, and thought she would
never want anything more; but after a while she
grew discontented again.</p>

<p>So back she went to the waterside and called
&ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the water bubbled, and the
little fairy stood beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, good woman?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house and
furniture, and now, if you please, ma&#8217;am, I would
like some new clothes. For I find that the clothes
I wore in the vinegar-bottle are not nearly good
enough for the mistress of such a pretty little
cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fairy said, &ldquo;Go home and you shall
have some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she found all her old clothes changed to new ones.
There was a silk dress and a flowered apron, and
a grand lace cap and high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p>Well, she was very happy, and she thought she
should never want anything more; but after a
while she grew discontented again.</p>

<p>So back she went to the waterside and called
&ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the water bubbled, and the
little fairy stood beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, good woman?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house and
furniture and clothes; and now, if you please, I
should like a maid. For I find when I have to do
the work of the house that my new clothes get
very dirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fairy said, &ldquo;Go home and you shall
have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she found at the door a neat little maid with a
broom in her hand, all ready to sweep the floor.</p>

<p>This made her very happy, and she thought she
would never want anything more; but after a
while she grew discontented again.</p>

<p>So back she went to the waterside and called
&ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the water bubbled, and the little
fairy stood beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, good woman?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house and
furniture, and clothes, and a maid; and now, if
you please, I should like a pony. For when I go
out walking my new clothes get very much
splashed with the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fairy said, &ldquo;Go home and you shall
have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she saw at the door a little pony all ready bridled
and saddled for her to ride.</p>

<p>She was very happy, and thought she would
never want anything more; but after a while she
grew discontented again.</p>

<p>So back she went to the waterside and called
&ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and the water bubbled, and the
little fairy stood beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, my good woman?&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house and
furniture, and clothes, and a maid, and a pony;
and now, if you please, ma&#8217;am, I should like a
covered cart. For I find that my new clothes get
quite as muddy riding as walking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fairy said, &ldquo;Go home and you will
find one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and there
she found her pony harnessed into a nice little
covered cart.</p>

<p>She had hardly seen the cart, when back she
ran to the waterside, calling &ldquo;Fairy, fairy&rdquo;; and
the water bubbled, and the little fairy stood beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>do</em> you want, good woman?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>And the little old woman answered: &ldquo;You have
been very kind, ma&#8217;am, in giving me a house and
furniture, and clothes, and a maid, and a pony
and a cart; but now, if you please, ma&#8217;am, I
should like a coach and six. For it is like all the
farmers&#8217; wives to ride about in a cart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the fairy said: &ldquo;Oh, you discontented little
old woman! The more I give you, the more
you want. Go back to your vinegar-bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the little old woman went home, and she
found everything gone&mdash;her cart, and her pony,
and her maid, and her clothes, and her furniture,
and her house. Nothing remained but the little
old vinegar-bottle, with the ladder to get up the
side.</p>

<h2>THE SNOW QUEEN</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy called
Kay. And there was a little girl. Her name was
Gerda.</p>

<p>They were not brother and sister, this little boy
and girl, but they lived in tiny attics next door to
one another.</p>

<p>When they were not playing together, Gerda
spent her time peeping at Kay, through one of the
little panes in her window. And Kay peeped
back at Gerda.</p>

<p>Outside each attic was a tiny balcony, just big
enough to hold two little stools and a window-box.
Often Gerda would step out of her attic
window into the balcony, carrying with her a
three-legged wooden stool. Then she would
climb over the low wall that separated her from
Kay.</p>

<p>And there in Kay&#8217;s balcony the two children
would sit and play together, or tell fairy tales, or
tend the flowers that bloomed so gaily in the window-box.</p>

<p>At other times it was Kay who would bound
over the low wall into Gerda&#8217;s balcony, and there,
too, the little boy and girl were as happy as
though they had been in Fairyland.</p>

<p>In each little window-box grew a rose-bush,
and the bloom and the scent of the red roses they
bore gave Kay and Gerda more delight than you
can imagine; and all her life long a red rose remained
little Gerda&#8217;s favorite flower.</p>

<p>But it was not always summer-time, and when
cold, frosty winter came, and the Snow Queen
sailed down on the large white snowflakes from
a gray sky, then no flowers bloomed in the window-boxes.
And the balcony was so slippery
that the children dared not venture to step out
of their attic windows, but had to run down one
long flight of stairs and up another to be able to
play together.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, Kay stayed in his own little
room and Gerda stayed in hers, gazing and
gazing at the lovely pictures of castles, and
mountains, and sea, and flowers that the Snow
Queen had drawn on the window-panes as she
passed.</p>

<p>But now that the little panes of glass were covered
with pictures, how could Kay and Gerda
peep at each other from the attic windows?</p>

<p>Ah, they had a plan, and a very good plan, too.
Kay would heat a penny on the stove, and then
press it against the window-pane, and so make
little round peep-holes. Then he would put his
eye to one of these little rounds and&mdash;what did he
see? A bright black eye peeping from Gerda&#8217;s attic,
for she, too, had heated a penny and made
peep-holes in her window.</p>

<p>It was in winter, too, when the children could
not play together on the balcony, that Gerda&#8217;s
grandmother told them stories of the Snow
Queen.</p>

<p>One night, as Kay was undressing to go to bed,
he climbed on a chair and peeped out of one of his
little round holes, and there, on the edge of the
window-box, were a few big snowflakes. And as
the little boy watched them, the biggest grew
bigger and bigger, until it grew into a white lady
of glittering, dazzling ice. Her eyes shone like
two bright stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the Snow Queen,&rdquo; thought Kay, and
at that moment the white lady nodded to him, and
waved her hand, and as he jumped from his chair,
he fancied she flew past the window. &ldquo;It must be
the Snow Queen.&rdquo; Would he ever see her again?</p>

<p>At last the white winter melted away and green
spring burst upon the earth. Then once more
summer&mdash;warm, bright, beautiful summer.</p>

<p>It was at five o&#8217;clock, one sunny afternoon, that
Kay and Gerda sat together on their little stools
in the balcony, looking at a picture-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Kay suddenly, &ldquo;oh, there is something
sharp in my eye, and I have such a pain in
my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerda put her arms round Kay&#8217;s neck and
looked into his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing, Kay dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it is gone now,&rdquo; said the boy, and they
turned again to the picture-book.</p>

<p>But something had flown into Kay&#8217;s eye, and it
was not gone; a little bit had reached his heart,
and it was still there. Listen, and I will tell you
what had happened.</p>

<p>There was about this time a most marvelous
mirror in the world. It belonged to the worst
hobgoblin that ever lived, and had been made by
his wicked little demons.</p>

<p>Those who looked into this mirror saw reflected
there all the mean and ugly people and things in
the world, and not one beautiful sight could they
see. And the thoughts of those who looked into
this mirror became as mean and ugly as the people
and things they saw.</p>

<p>This delighted the hobgoblin, who ordered his
little demons to carry the mirror all over the world
and to do as much mischief with it as they could.</p>

<p>But one day, when they had traveled far, the
mirror slipped from the hands of the little imps,
and fell to earth, shivered into hundreds of thousands
of millions of bits. Then it did more harm
than ever, for the tiny pieces, some no bigger than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
a grain of sand, were blown all over the world,
and often flew in people&#8217;s eyes, and sometimes
even found their way into their hearts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/img171.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;they flew up and up on a dark cloud&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when a big person or a child had a little
bit of this magic mirror in his eye, he saw only
what was mean and ugly; and if the tiniest grain
of the glass reached his heart, alas! alas! it froze
all the kindness and gentleness and love that was
there, and the heart became like a lump of ice.</p>

<p>This is what had happened to poor little Kay.
One tiny bit of the magic mirror had flown into
his eye; another had entered his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How horrid you look, Gerda. Why are you
crying? And oh, see the worm in that rose.
Roses are ugly, and so are window-boxes.&rdquo; And
Kay kicked the window-box, and knocked two
roses from the rose-bush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay dear, what is the matter?&rdquo; asked Gerda.</p>

<p>The little boy did not answer, but broke off
another rose, and then, without saying good-by,
stepped in at his own window, leaving Gerda
alone.</p>

<p>The next time the little girl brought out the
picture-book, Kay tore the leaves, and when the
grandmother told them a story, he interrupted her
and made ugly faces. And he would tread on
Gerda&#8217;s toes and pull her hair, and make faces at
her, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How cruel little Kay grows,&rdquo; said his friends;
for he mocked the old people and ill-treated those
who were weak. And all through the blue summer
and the yellow autumn Kay teased little
Gerda, or left her that he might play with the
bigger children in the town.</p>

<p>But it was when winter came, and the big white
snowflakes once more fell from a gray sky, that
Gerda felt loneliest, for Kay now drew on his
thick gloves, slung his little sledge across his
back, and marched off alone. &ldquo;I am going to ride
in the square,&rdquo; he shouted in her ear as he passed.
But Gerda could not answer; she could only think
of the winters that had gone, when she and Kay
always sat side by side in that same little sledge.
How happy they had been! Oh, why, why had
he not taken her with him?</p>

<p>Kay walked briskly to the square, and there he
watched the bolder of the boys tie their sledges to
the farmers&#8217; carts. With what glee they felt
themselves being drawn over the snow-covered
ground! When they reached the town gates they
would jump out, unfasten their sledges, and
return to the square to begin the fun all over
again.</p>

<p>Kay was thinking how much he would like to
tie his little sledge behind a cart, when a big
sledge, painted white, drove by. In it sat some
one muffled in a white fur coat and cap. Twice
the sledge drove round the square.</p>

<p>As it passed Kay the second time, he quickly
fastened on his little sledge behind, and in a moment
found himself flying through the streets.
What fun! On and on through snowdrifts, bounding
over ditches, rushing down hills, faster and
faster they flew.</p>

<p>Little Kay grew frightened. Twice he tried to
unfasten the string that tied his sledge to the
other, but both times the white driver turned
round and nodded to him to sit still. At last they
had driven through the town gates. The snow
fell so heavily that it blinded him. Now he could
not see where they were going, and Kay grew
more frightened still. He tried to say his prayers,
but could only remember the multiplication
table. Bigger and bigger grew the snowflakes,
till they seemed like large white birds. Then,
suddenly, the sledge stopped. The driver stood
up. She was a tall lady, dazzlingly white. Her
eyes shone like two stars. She was the Snow
Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is cold,&rdquo; said the white lady; &ldquo;come into my
sledge. Now, creep inside my furs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kay did as he was told, but he felt as if he had
fallen into a snowdrift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are still cold,&rdquo; said the Snow Queen, and
she kissed his forehead. Her lips were like ice,
and Kay shivered and felt the old pain at his
heart. But only for a minute, for the Snow
Queen kissed him again, and then he forgot the
pain, and he forgot Gerda, and he forgot his
grandmother and his old home, and had not a
thought for anything or any one but the Snow
Queen.</p>

<p>He had no fear of her now, no, not although
they flew up and up on a dark cloud, away over
woods and lakes, over rivers, islands, and seas.
No, he was not afraid, although the cold wind
whistled around them, and beneath the wild
wolves howled. Kay did not care.</p>

<p>Above them the moon shone bright and clear.
All night long the boy would gaze at it and the
twinkling stars, but by day he slept at the feet of
the Snow Queen.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>But what of little Gerda?</p>

<p>Poor child, she watched and she waited and she
wondered, but Kay did not come, and nobody
could tell her where he was. The boys had seen
him drive out of the town gates behind a big
sledge painted white. But no one had heard of
him since.</p>

<p>Little Gerda cried bitterly. Perhaps Kay was
drowned in the river. Oh, what a long, cold winter
that was! But spring came at last, bright
spring with its golden sunshine and its singing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay is dead,&rdquo; said Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay dead? It is not true,&rdquo; said the sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay dead? We do not believe it,&rdquo; twittered
the swallows.</p>

<p>And neither did little Gerda believe it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will put on my new red shoes,&rdquo; said the
child one morning, &ldquo;and go to the river and ask
it about Kay.&rdquo; So she put on her little red shoes,
and kissed her old grandmother who was still
asleep, and wandered alone, out beyond the town
gates, and down to the river-bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you taken my little playfellow?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I will give you these if you will bring
him back to me,&rdquo; and she flung her little shoes
into the river.</p>

<p>They fell close to the bank and the little waves
tossed them back on to the dry pebbles at her feet.
&ldquo;We do not want you, we will keep Kay,&rdquo; they
seemed to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did not throw them far enough,&rdquo;
thought Gerda; and, stepping into a boat
that lay among the rushes, she flung the red
shoes with all her might into the middle of the
river.</p>

<p>But the boat was not fastened and it glided out
from among the rushes. Soon it was drifting
faster and faster down the river. The little shoes
floated behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am going to little Kay,&rdquo; thought
Gerda, as she was carried farther and farther
down the river. How pretty it was! Trees waved
and flowers nodded on its banks. Sheep grazed
and cattle browsed, but not one soul, big or little,
was to be seen.</p>

<p>After a long time Gerda came to a cherry-garden
which stretched down to the river-bank. At
the end of this garden stood a tiny cottage with a
thatched roof, and with red, blue, and yellow glass
windows.</p>

<p>On either side of the door stood a wooden soldier.
Gerda thought the soldiers were alive, and
shouted to them.</p>

<p>The wooden soldiers, of course, did not hear,
but an old, old woman, who lived in the tiny
house, wondered who it could be that called. She
hobbled out, leaning on her hooked stick. On her
head she wore a big sun-hat, and on it were
painted beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; said the old, old woman,
walking straight into the river, and catching hold
of the boat with her hooked stick; &ldquo;you poor
dear!&rdquo; And she pulled the boat ashore and lifted
out little Gerda on to the green grass.</p>

<p>Gerda was delighted to be on dry land again,
but she was a little bit afraid of the old, old
woman, who now asked her who she was and
where she came from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am looking for Kay, little Kay. Have you
seen him?&rdquo; began Gerda, and she went on to tell
the old, old woman the whole story of her playmate
and his strange disappearance. When she
had finished, she asked again, &ldquo;Have you seen
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old, old woman, &ldquo;but I expect
him. Come in,&rdquo; and she took little Gerda by the
hand. &ldquo;Come to my house and taste my cherries.&rdquo;
And when they had gone into the cottage, the
old, old woman locked the door. Then she gave
Gerda a plate of the most delicious cherries, and
while the little girl ate them, the old, old woman
combed her hair with a golden comb.</p>

<p>Now this old, old woman was a witch, and the
comb was a magic comb, for as soon as it touched
her hair, Gerda forgot all about Kay. And this
was just what the witch wished, for she was a
lonely old woman, and would have liked Gerda to
become her own little girl and stay with her always.</p>

<p>Gerda did enjoy the red cherries, and, while she
was still eating them, the old, old woman stole
out to the garden and waved her hooked stick
over the rose-bushes and they quickly sank beneath
the brown earth. For Gerda had told her
how fond Kay had once been of their little rose-bushes
in the balcony, and the witch was afraid
the sight of roses would remind the little girl of
her lost playmate. But now that the roses had
vanished, Gerda might come into the garden.</p>

<p>How the child danced for joy past the lilies
and bluebells, how she suddenly fell on her knees
to smell the pinks and mignonette, and then
danced off again, in and out among the sunflowers
and hollyhocks!</p>

<p>Gerda was perfectly happy now, and played
among the flowers until the sun sank behind the
cherry-trees. Then the old, old woman again
took her by the hand, and led her to the little
house. And she undressed her and put her into
a little bed of white violets, and there the little
girl dreamed sweet dreams.</p>

<p>The next day and the next again and for many
more Gerda played among the flowers in the garden.</p>

<p>One morning, as the old woman sat near, Gerda
looked at her hat with the wonderful painted
flowers. Prettiest of all was a rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rose! Why, surely I have seen none in the
garden,&rdquo; thought Gerda, and she danced off in
search.</p>

<p>But she could find none, and in her disappointment
hot tears fell. And they fell on the very
spot where the roses had grown, and as soon as
the warm drops moistened the earth, the rose-bushes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
sprang up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful, beautiful,&rdquo; she said; but in
a moment the tears fell again, for she thought of
the rose-bushes in the balcony, and she remembered
Kay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Kay, dear, dear Kay, is he dead?&rdquo; she
asked the roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is not dead,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;for we
have been beneath the brown earth, and he is not
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where, oh, where is he?&rdquo; and she went
from flower to flower whispering, &ldquo;Have you
seen little Kay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the flowers stood in the sunshine, dreaming
their own dreams, and these they told the
little maiden gladly, but of Kay they could not
tell her, for they knew nothing.</p>

<p>Then the little girl ran down the garden path
until she came to the garden gate. She pressed
the rusty latch. The gate flew open, and Gerda
ran out on her little bare feet into the green
fields. And she ran, and she ran, until she could
run no longer. Then she sat down on a big stone
to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it must be autumn,&rdquo; she said sorrowfully,
as she looked around. And little Gerda
felt sorry that she had stayed so long in the magic
garden, where it was always summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have I not been seeking little Kay?&rdquo; she
asked herself, and she jumped up and trudged
along, on and on, out into the great wide world.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>At last the cold white winter came again, and
still little Gerda was wandering alone through
the wide world, for she had not found little Kay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caw, caw,&rdquo; said a big raven that hopped on
the stone in front of her. &ldquo;Caw, caw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen little Kay?&rdquo; asked Gerda, and
she told the bird her sad story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been Kay,&rdquo; said the raven, &ldquo;I
cannot tell. But if it was, he will have forgotten
you now that he lives with the princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he live with a princess?&rdquo; asked Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does. If you care to listen, I will tell
you how it came about. In this kingdom lives a
princess so clever that she has read all the newspapers
in the world, and forgotten them again.
Last winter she made up her mind to marry. Her
husband, she said, must speak well. He must
know the proper thing to say, and say it prettily.
Otherwise she would not marry. I assure you
what I say is perfectly true, for I have a tame
sweetheart who lives at court, and she told me
the whole story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day it was published in the newspapers
that any handsome young man might go to the
palace to speak to the princess. The one who
spoke most prettily and answered most wisely
should be chosen as her husband. What a stir
there was! Young men flocked to the palace in
crowds, chattering as they came. But when they
saw the great staircase, and the soldiers in their
silver uniform, and the grand ladies in velvet and
lace, they could only talk in whispers. And when
they were led before the beautiful princess, who
was seated on a pearl as big as a spinning-wheel,
they were silent. She spoke to them, but they
could think of nothing to say, so they repeated
her last words over and over again. The princess
did not like that, and she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Kay, little Kay, did he come?&rdquo; interrupted
Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in too great a hurry,&rdquo; said the raven;
&ldquo;I am just coming to that. On the third day
came a boy with sparkling eyes and golden hair,
but his clothes were shabby. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be Kay. Dear, dear Kay, I
have found him at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had a knapsack on his back, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it must have been a sledge,&rdquo; again interrupted
Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said he had a knapsack on his back, and he
wore boots that creaked, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then it must be Kay, for he had new
boots. I heard them creak through our attic
wall when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little girl, do not interrupt, but listen to me.
He wore boots that creaked, but even that did
not frighten him. He creaked up the great staircase,
he passed the soldiers in silver uniform, he
bowed to the ladies in velvet and lace, and still
he was quite at his ease. And when he was led
before the beautiful princess who was seated on
a pearl as big as a spinning-wheel, he answered
so prettily and spoke so wisely that she chose him
as her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed it was Kay,&rdquo; said little Gerda.
&ldquo;He was so clever. He could do arithmetic up
to long division. Oh, take me to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see what can be done,&rdquo; said the raven.
&ldquo;I will talk about it to my tame sweetheart. She
will certainly be able to advise us. Wait here by
the stile,&rdquo; and the raven wagged his head and
flew off.</p>

<p>It was growing dark before he returned.
&ldquo;Here is a roll my tame sweetheart sent you.
&lsquo;The little maiden must be hungry,&rsquo; she said.
As for your going to the palace with those bare
feet&mdash;the thing is impossible. The soldiers in silver
uniform would not let you go up the great
stair. But do not cry. My sweetheart knows a
little back staircase. She will take you to the
prince and princess. Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;you poor child,&rsquo; said the old woman,<br />
walking straight into the river&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On tiptoe little Gerda followed the raven, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
he hopped across the snow-covered field and up
the long avenue that led to the palace garden.
And in the garden they waited silently until the
last light had gone out. Then they turned along
the bare walk that led to the back door. It stood
wide open.</p>

<p>Oh, how little Gerda&#8217;s heart beat, as on the
tips of her little bare toes she followed the raven
up the dimly lighted back staircase!</p>

<p>On the landing at the top burned a small lamp.
Beside it stood the tame sweetheart.</p>

<p>Gerda curtsied as her grandmother had taught
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; said the tame sweetheart, nodding to the
raven of the field, &ldquo;he has told me your story. It
has made me sad. But if you carry the lamp, I
will lead the way, and then we shall see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see little Kay,&rdquo; murmured Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! we shall see what we shall see,&rdquo; said
the tame sweetheart.</p>

<p>Through room after room Gerda followed her
strange guide, her heart thumping and thumping
so loudly that she was afraid some one in the palace
would hear it and wake.</p>

<p>At last they came to a room in which stood
two little beds, one white and one red. The tame
sweetheart nodded to the little girl.</p>

<p>Poor Gerda! she was trembling all over, as she
peeped at the little head that rested on the pillow
of the white bed.</p>

<p>Oh! that was the princess.</p>

<p>Gerda turned to the little red bed. The prince
was lying on his face, but the hair, surely it was
Kay&#8217;s hair. She drew down the little red coverlet
until she saw a brown neck. Yes! it was
Kay&#8217;s neck, she felt sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay, Kay, it is I, little Gerda, wake, wake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the prince awoke. He turned his head.
He opened his eyes&mdash;and&mdash;alas! alas! it was not
little Kay.</p>

<p>Then Gerda cried and cried as if her heart
would break. She cried until she awoke the princess,
who started up bewildered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, little girl, and where do you
come from, and what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want Kay, little Kay, do you know
where he is?&rdquo; And Gerda told the princess all
her story, and of what the ravens had done to
help her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little child,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;how sad
you must feel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how tired,&rdquo; said the prince, and he
jumped out of his little red bed, and made Gerda
lie down.</p>

<p>The little girl was grateful indeed. She folded
her hands and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>And Gerda dreamed of Kay. She saw him
sitting in his little sledge, and it was dragged by
angels. But it was only a dream, and, when she
awoke, her little playmate was as far away as
ever.</p>

<p>The ravens were now very happy, for the
princess said that, although they must never
again lead any one to the palace by the back staircase,
this time they should be rewarded. They
should for the rest of their lives live together in
the palace garden, and be known as the court
ravens, and be fed from the royal kitchen.</p>

<p>When little Gerda awoke from her dreams, she
saw the sunbeams stealing across her bed. It
was time to get up.</p>

<p>The court ladies dressed the little girl in silk
and velvet, and the prince and princess asked her
to stay with them at the palace. But Gerda
begged for a little carriage, and a horse, and a
pair of boots, that she might again go out into
the great wide world to seek little Kay.</p>

<p>So they gave her a pair of boots and a muff,
and when she was dressed, there before the door
stood a carriage of pure gold. The prince himself
helped Gerda to step in, and the princess
waved to her as she drove off.</p>

<p>But although Gerda was now a grand little
girl, she was very lonely. The coachman and
footman in the scarlet and gold livery did not
speak a word. She was glad when the field raven
flew to the carriage and perched by her side. He
explained that his wife, for he was now married,
would have come also, but she had eaten too
much breakfast and was not well. But at the end
of three miles the raven said good-by, and flapping
his shiny black wings, flew into an elm.
There he watched the golden carriage till it could
no longer be seen.</p>

<p>Poor Gerda was lonely as ever! There were
gingernuts and sugar-biscuits and fruit in the
carriage, but these could not comfort the little
girl.</p>

<p>When would she find Kay?</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In a dark forest lived a band of wild robbers.
Among them was an old robber-woman, with
shaggy eyebrows and no teeth. She had one little
daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, look! what is that?&rdquo; cried the little
robber-girl one afternoon, as something like a
moving torch gleamed through the forest. It was
Gerda&#8217;s golden carriage. The robbers rushed toward
it, drove away the coachman and the footman,
and dragged out the little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How plump she is! You will taste nice, my
dear,&rdquo; the old woman said to Gerda, as she drew
out her long, sharp knife. It glittered horribly.
&ldquo;Now, just stand still, so, and&mdash;oh! stop, I say,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
stop,&rdquo; screamed the old woman, for at that moment
her daughter sprang upon her back and bit
her ear. And there she hung like some savage
little animal. &ldquo;Oh, my ear, my ear, you bad,
wicked child!&rdquo; But the woman did not now try
to kill Gerda.</p>

<p>Then the robber-child said, &ldquo;Little girl, I want
you myself, and I want to ride beside you.&rdquo; So
together they stepped into the golden carriage
and drove deep into the wood. &ldquo;No one will hurt
you now, unless I get angry with you,&rdquo; said the
robber-girl, putting her arm round Gerda. &ldquo;Are
you a princess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gerda, and she told the robber-girl
all her story. &ldquo;Have you seen little Kay?&rdquo; she
ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the robber-girl, &ldquo;never.&rdquo; Then
she looked at Gerda and added, &ldquo;No one shall kill
you even if I am angry with you. I shall do it
myself.&rdquo; And she dried Gerda&#8217;s eyes. &ldquo;Now
this is nice,&rdquo; and she lay back, her red hands in
Gerda&#8217;s warm, soft muff.</p>

<p>At last the carriage stopped at a robber&#8217;s castle.
It was a ruin. The robber-girl led Gerda
into a large, old hall and gave her a basin of hot
soup. &ldquo;You shall sleep there to-night,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;with me and my pets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerda looked where the robber-girl pointed, and
saw that in one corner of the room straw was
scattered on the stone floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall see my pets. Come, lie down
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And little Gerda and the robber-girl lay down
together on their straw bed. Above, perched on
poles, were doves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine, all mine,&rdquo; said the little robber-girl.
Jumping up, she seized the dove nearest her by
the feet and shook it till its wings flapped. Then
she slung it against Gerda&#8217;s face. &ldquo;Kiss it,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Yes, all mine; and look,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;he
is mine, too;&rdquo; and she caught by the horn a
reindeer that was tied to the wall. He had
a bright brass collar round his neck. &ldquo;We
have to keep him tied or he would run away.
I tickle him every night with my sharp knife,
and then he is afraid;&rdquo; and the girl drew
from a hole in the wall a long knife, and
gently ran it across the reindeer&#8217;s neck. The
poor animal kicked, but the little robber-girl
laughed, and then again lay down on her bed of
straw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Gerda, with terror in her eyes,
&ldquo;you are not going to sleep with that long, sharp
knife in your hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I always do,&rdquo; replied the robber-girl;
&ldquo;one never knows what may happen. But tell me
again all about Kay, and about your journey
through the wide world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Gerda told all her story over again. Then
the little robber-girl put one arm round Gerda&#8217;s
neck, and with her long knife in the other, she
fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>But Gerda could not sleep. How could she,
with that sharp knife close beside her? She
would try not to think of it. She would listen to
the doves. &ldquo;Coo, coo,&rdquo; they said. Then they
came nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have seen little Kay,&rdquo; they whispered.
&ldquo;He floated by above our nest in the Snow
Queen&#8217;s sledge. She blew upon us as she passed,
and her icy breath killed many of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where was little Kay going? Where does
the Snow Queen live?&rdquo; asked Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reindeer can tell you everything,&rdquo; said
the doves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the reindeer, &ldquo;I can tell you. Little
Kay was going to the Snow Queen&#8217;s palace,
a splendid palace of glittering ice, away in Lapland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kay, little Kay!&rdquo; sighed Gerda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie still, or I shall stick my knife into you,&rdquo;
said the little robber-girl.</p>

<p>And little Gerda lay still, but she did not sleep.
In the morning she told the robber-girl what the
doves and the reindeer had said.</p>

<p>The little robber-girl looked very solemn and
thoughtful. Then she nodded her head importantly.
At last she spoke, not to Gerda, but to
the reindeer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to keep you here always, tied by
your brass collar to that wall. Then I should
still tickle you with my knife, and have the fun
of seeing you kick and struggle. But never mind.
Do you know where Lapland is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapland! of course the reindeer knew.
Had he not been born there? Had he not
played in its snow-covered fields? As the reindeer
thought of his happy childhood, his eyes
danced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to go back to your old home?&rdquo;
asked the robber-girl.</p>

<p>The reindeer leaped into the air for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will soon untie your chain.
Mother is still asleep. Come along, Gerda. Now,
I am going to put this little girl on your back,
and you are to carry her safely to the Snow
Queen&#8217;s palace. She must find her little playfellow.&rdquo;
And the robber-girl lifted Gerda up and
tied her on the reindeer&#8217;s back, having first put
a little cushion beneath her. &ldquo;I must keep your
muff, Gerda, but you can have mother&#8217;s big, black
mittens. Come, put your hands in. Oh, they do
look ugly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Kay, little Kay,&rdquo; and Gerda
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
cried for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to whimper about,&rdquo; said the
robber-girl. &ldquo;Look! here are two loaves and a
ham.&rdquo; Then she opened wide the door, loosened
the reindeer&#8217;s chain, and said, &ldquo;Now run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the reindeer darted through the open door,
Gerda waving her blackmittened hands, and the
little robber-girl calling after the reindeer, &ldquo;Take
care of my little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On and on they sped, over briers and bushes,
through fields and forests and swamps. The
wolves howled and the ravens screamed. But
Gerda was happy. She was going to Kay.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The loaves and the ham were finished, and
Gerda and the reindeer were in Lapland.</p>

<p>They stopped in front of a little hut. Its roof
sloped down almost to the ground, and the door
was so low that to get into the hut one had to
creep on hands and knees. How the reindeer
squeezed through I cannot tell, but there he was
in the little hut, telling an old Lapp woman who
was frying fish over a lamp, first his own story
and then the sad story of Gerda and little Kay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor creatures,&rdquo; said the Lapp
woman, &ldquo;the Snow Queen is not in Lapland at
present. She is hundreds of miles away at her
palace in Finland. But I will give you a note to
a Finn woman, and she will direct you better than
I can.&rdquo; And the Lapp woman wrote a letter on
a dried fish, as she had no paper.</p>

<p>Then, when Gerda had warmed herself by the
lamp, the Lapp woman tied her on to the reindeer
again, and they squeezed through the little
door and were once more out in the wide world.</p>

<p>On and on they sped through the long night,
while the blue northern lights flickered in the sky
overhead, and the crisp snow crackled beneath
their feet.</p>

<p>At last they reached Finland and knocked on
the Finn woman&#8217;s chimney, for she had no door
at all. Then they squeezed down the chimney
and found themselves in a very hot little room.</p>

<p>The old woman at once loosened Gerda&#8217;s
things, and took off her mittens and boots. Then
she put ice on the reindeer&#8217;s head. Now that her
visitors were more comfortable she could look at
the letter they brought. She read it three times
and then put it in the fish-pot, for this old woman
never wasted anything.</p>

<p>There was silence for five minutes, and then
the reindeer again told his story first, and afterward
the sad story of Gerda and little Kay.</p>

<p>Once more there was silence for five minutes,
and then the Finn woman whispered to the reindeer.
This is what she whispered: &ldquo;Yes, little
Kay is with the Snow Queen, and thinks himself
the happiest boy in the world. But that is because
a little bit of the magic mirror is still in
his eye, and another tiny grain remains in his
heart. Until they come out, he can never be the
old Kay. As long as they are there, the Snow
Queen will have him in her power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But cannot you give Gerda power to overcome
the Snow Queen?&rdquo; whispered the reindeer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot give her greater power than she has
already. Her own loving heart has won the help
of bird and beast and robber-girl, and it is that
loving heart that will conquer the Snow Queen.
But this you can do. Carry little Gerda to the
palace garden. It is only two miles from here.
You will see a bush covered with red berries.
Leave Gerda there and hurry back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off sped the reindeer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boots and my mittens!&rdquo; cried Gerda.</p>

<p>But the reindeer would not stop. On he rushed
through the snow until he came to the bush with
the red berries. There he put Gerda down and
kissed her, while tears trickled down his face.
Then off he bounded, leaving the little girl standing
barefoot on the crisp snow.</p>

<p>Gerda stepped forward. Huge snowflakes were
coming to meet her. They did not fall from the
sky. No, they were marching along the ground.
And what strange shapes they took! Some
looked like white hedgehogs, some like polar
bears. They were the Snow Queen&#8217;s soldiers.</p>

<p>Gerda grew frightened. But she did not run
away. She folded her hands and closed her eyes.
&ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven,&rdquo; she began, but
she could get no further. The cold was so great
that she could not go on. She opened her eyes,
and there, surrounding her, was a legion of bright
little angels. They had been formed from her
breath, as she prayed, &ldquo;Our Father which art in
heaven.&rdquo; And the bright little angels shivered
into a hundred pieces the snowflake army, and
Gerda walked on fearlessly toward the palace of
the Snow Queen.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Little Kay sits alone in the great ice hall. He
does not know that he is blue with cold, for the
Snow Queen has kissed away the icy shiverings
and left his heart with no more feeling than a
lump of ice.</p>

<p>And this morning she has flown off to visit the
countries of the south, where the grapes and
the lemons grow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all so blue there,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;I must
go and cast my veil of white across their hills
and meadows.&rdquo; And away she flew.</p>

<p>So Kay sits in the great ice hall alone. Chips
of ice are his only playthings, and now he leaves
them on the ice-floor and goes to the window to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
gaze at the snowdrifts in the palace garden.
Great gusts of wind swirl the snow past the windows.
Kay can see nothing. He turns again to
his ice toys.</p>

<p>Outside, little Gerda struggles through the biting
wind, then, saying her morning prayer, she
enters the vast hall. At a glance she sees the
lonely boy. In a twinkling she knows it is Kay.
Her little bare feet carry her like wings across
the ice floor. Her arms are round his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kay, dear, dear Kay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Kay does not move. He is still and cold
as the palace walls.</p>

<p>Little Gerda bursts into tears, hot, scalding
tears. Her arms are yet round Kay&#8217;s neck, and
her tears fall upon his heart of ice. They thaw
it. They reach the grain of glass, and it melts
away.</p>

<p>And now Kay&#8217;s tears fall hot and fast, and as
they pour, the tiny bit of glass passes out of his
eye, and he sees, he knows, his long-lost playmate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Gerda, little Gerda!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;where
have you been, where have you been, where are
we now?&rdquo; and he shivers as he looks round the
vast cold hall.</p>

<p>But Gerda kisses his white cheeks, and they
grow rosy; she kisses his eyes, and they shine
like stars; she kisses his hands and feet, and he is
strong and glad.</p>

<p>Hand in hand they wander out of the ice
palace. The winds hush, the sun bursts forth.
They talk of their grandmother, of their rose-trees.</p>

<p>The reindeer has come back, and with him
there waits another reindeer. They stand by the
bush with the red berries.</p>

<p>The children bound on to their backs, and are
carried first to the hut of the Finn woman, and
then on to Lapland. The Lapp woman has new
clothes ready for them, and brings out her sledge.
Once more Kay and Gerda are sitting side by
side. The Lapp woman drives, and the two reindeer
follow. On and on they speed through the
white-robed land. But now they leave it behind.
The earth wears her mantle of green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; they say to the kind Lapp woman;
&ldquo;good-by&rdquo; to the gentle reindeer.</p>

<p>Together the children enter a forest. How
strange and how sweet the song of the birds!</p>

<p>A young girl on horseback comes galloping toward
them. She wears a scarlet cap, and has
pistols in her belt. It is the robber-girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have found little Kay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerda smiles a radiant smile, and asks for the
prince and princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are traveling far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the raven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the raven is dead. But tell me what you
have been doing, and where you found little
Kay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three children sit down under a fir-tree,
and Gerda tells of her journey through Lapland
and Finland, and how at last she had found little
Kay in the palace of the Snow Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snip, snap, snorra!&rdquo; shouts the robber-girl,
which is her way of saying &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; Then,
promising that if ever she is near their town, she
will pay them a visit, off she gallops into the wide
world.</p>

<p>On wander the two children, on and on. At
last they see the tall towers of the old town where
they had lived together. Soon they come to the
narrow street they remember so well. They
climb the long, long stair, and burst into the little
attic.</p>

<p>The rose-bush is in bloom, and the sun pours
in upon the old grandmother, who reads her Bible
by the open window.</p>

<p>Kay and Gerda take their two little stools and
sit down one on either side of her, and listen to
the words from the Good Book. As they listen,
a great peace steals into their souls.</p>

<p>And outside it is summer&mdash;warm, bright,
beautiful summer.</p>

<h2>THE MASTER-MAID</h2>


<p>Once there was a King who had a son, and
this Prince would not stay at home, but went a
long, long way off to a very far country. There
he met a Giant; and though it seems a strange
thing for a King&#8217;s son to do, the Prince went to
the Giant&#8217;s house to be his servant, and the Giant
gave the Prince a room, to sleep in, which, very
strangely, had a door on every side. However,
the Prince thought little of this, for he was very
tired, and he went quickly to bed, and slept
soundly all night.</p>

<p>Now, the Giant had a large herd of goats; and
very likely the Prince thought the Giant would
send him to herd the goats. But the Giant did
nothing of the sort. In the morning he prepared
to take the goats to pasture himself; but before
he set out he told the Prince that he expected
him to clean the stable before he came back in
the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a very easy master,&rdquo; said the Giant,
&ldquo;and that is all I expect you to do. But remember,
I expect the work to be well done.&rdquo; Then,
before he reached the door, he turned back and
said, in a threatening way: &ldquo;You are not to
open a single one of the doors in your room. If
you do, I shall kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Giant shut the door in a way that
seemed to say, &ldquo;I mean every word I have said,&rdquo;
and he went off with his goats, and left the Prince
alone.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the Prince drummed for a
while with his fingers on the window. Then,
when the Giant and his flock had gone out of
sight, he began to walk about the room, whistling
to himself and looking at the forbidden doors.</p>

<p>The house seemed silent and lonely, and he
really had nothing to do. To clean a stable with
only one stall seemed a very small task for a
sturdy boy like him.</p>

<p>At last he said to himself: &ldquo;I wonder what the
Giant keeps behind those doors? I think I shall
look and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the Giant had been there the Prince would
have paid dear for his curiosity; but he was far
away, and the Prince boldly opened the first door,
and inside he saw a huge pot, or cauldron, boiling
away merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a strange thing,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;there
is no fire under the pot. I must go in and see it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And into the room he went, and bent down to
see what queer soup it was that boiled without a
fire. As he did so, a lock of his hair dipped into
the pot; and when he raised his head, the lock
looked like bronze. The cauldron was full of
boiling copper.</p>

<p>He went out and closed the door carefully
behind him; and, wondering if there was a copper
pot in the next room, he opened the second door.
There was a cauldron inside, boiling merrily; but
there was no fire to be seen. He went over and
looked into the pot; and as it did not look exactly
like the first one, he dipped in another lock.
When he raised his head, up came the lock,
weighted heavily with silver. The cauldron was
full of boiling silver.</p>

<p>Wondering greatly at the Giant&#8217;s riches, the
Prince went out, closed the door very carefully,
and opened the third door. He almost tip-toed
into this room, he was so curious; but he went
through the same performance. And when he
raised his head from the third pot that boiled
without a fire, the third lock of hair was like a
heavy tassel of gold. The third pot was full of
boiling gold.</p>

<p>Full of amazement at the Giant&#8217;s great riches,
the Prince hurried out of the room, and closed
the door with the greatest care. By this time he
was so full of curiosity that he ran as fast as he
could to the fourth door. And yet he scarcely
dared to open it to see the riches he was sure it
hid behind it.</p>

<p>However, he opened it, very gently and very
quietly; and there on the bench, in the window,
looking out, sat a beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>Although the door opened very quietly, she
heard the sound, and looked up. And when she
saw the handsome young Prince standing in the
doorway, she started toward him, and cried in
great distress: &ldquo;O boy, boy! why have you come
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince told her he had come to serve the
Giant, and found him a very easy master. Indeed,
he said the Giant had given him nothing
to do that day but clean the stable.</p>

<p>The maiden told him that if he tried to clean
it as everyone else did, he would never finish the
work, because for every pitchforkful he threw
out, ten would come back.</p>

<p>The thing to do, she said, was to use the handle
of his pitchfork, and the work would soon be
done.</p>

<p>The Prince said he would follow her advice;
and then they sat all day and talked of pleasant
things. Indeed, they liked each other so well
that they very soon settled that they would get
married.</p>

<p>When it came toward evening, the maiden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
reminded the Prince that the Giant would soon
be home. So the youth went out to clean the
stable. First, he tried to do the work as any
other boy would do it; but when he found that
in a very short time he would not have room
to stand, he quickly turned the pitchfork around
and used the handle. In a few moments the
stable was as clean as a stable could be. Then
he went back to his room and wandered about it
with his hands in his pockets, looking quite as
innocent as if he had not raised the latch of a
single door.</p>

<p>Soon the Giant came in and asked if his work
was done. The Prince said it was. Of course,
the Giant did not believe him; but he went out
to see. When he came back he said very decidedly
to the Prince: &ldquo;You have been talking to my
Master-Maid. You could not have learned how
to clean that stable yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Prince made himself appear as if he
had never heard of the maiden before, and asked
such stupid questions that the Giant went away
satisfied, and left him to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, before the Giant set out with
his goats, he again told the Prince that he would
find he was an easy master: all he had to do that
day was to catch the Giant&#8217;s horse that was
feeding on the mountain-side. And having set
him this task, the Giant said that if the Prince
opened one of the doors he would kill him. Then
he took his staff, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>Quick as the Giant disappeared, the Prince,
who had no more interest in the other rooms,
opened the fourth door. The maiden asked him
about his day&#8217;s task; and when she heard it; she
told the Prince that the horse would rush at him
with flame bursting from its nostrils, and its
mouth wide open to tear him. But, she said, if
he would take the bridle that hung on the crook
by the door, and fling it straight into the horse&#8217;s
mouth, the beast would become quite tame. He
promised to do so; and they talked all day of
pleasant things. And when it came toward evening
the maiden reminded him that the Giant
would soon be home.</p>

<p>So the Prince went out to catch the horse;
and everything happened as the maiden said. But
when the fiery horse rushed at him with open
mouth he watched his opportunity, and just at the
right moment he flung the bridle in between its
teeth, and the horse stood still. Then the Prince
mounted it and rode it quietly home. He put the
horse in the stable, and went to his room, sat
down and whistled to himself as if he did not
know there was a maiden in the world.</p>

<p>Very soon the Giant came in, and asked about
the horse, and the Prince said very quietly that it
was in the stable. The Giant did not believe him;
but he went to see, and again accused the Prince
of having been talking to his Master-Maid.</p>

<p>The Prince pretended to be stupid, and asked
silly questions, and said he would like to see the
maid. &ldquo;You shall see her soon enough,&rdquo; the
Giant promised, and went away and left the
Prince to go to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day, before the Giant set out, he told
the Prince to go down underground and fetch
his taxes. Then he warned the Prince not to
touch the doors, and went off with his goats.</p>

<p>No sooner was he out of sight than the Prince
rushed to the maiden, and asked her how he was
to find his way underground to get the taxes,
and how much he should ask for. She took him
to the window and pointed out a rocky ledge. He
must go there, she said, take a club that hung
beside it, and knock on the rocky wall. As soon
as he did so, a fiery monster would come out,
and ask his errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But remember,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;when he
asks how much you want, you are to say: &lsquo;As
much as I can carry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince promised to do as she said, and
they sat down close together and talked until the
evening of what they would do when they escaped
from the Giant and went home to get married.</p>

<p>When evening came the maiden reminded the
Prince of the Giant&#8217;s coming, and he went to get
the money from the fiery monster. Everything
happened as the maiden said; and when the
monster, with sparks flying everywhere from him,
asked fiercely, &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; the
Prince was not in the least afraid, but said: &ldquo;As
much as I can carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing you did not ask for a horse-load,&rdquo;
said the monster; and he took the Prince
in and filled a sack, which was as much as the
Prince could do to carry. Indeed, that was nothing
to what the Prince saw there, for gold and
silver coins lay around, inside the mountain, like
pebbles on the seashore.</p>

<p>The Prince carried the money back to the
Giant&#8217;s house; and when the Giant reached home,
the Prince sat quietly in his room, whistling softly,
just as if he had never risen from his seat
since the Giant left.</p>

<p>The Giant demanded the money for his taxes.
&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said the Prince, showing him the
bursting sack. The Giant examined the money,
and then again accused the Prince of having been
talking to the Master-Maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;this is the third day
you have talked about the Master-Maid. Will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
you let me see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Giant looked at the Prince from under his
bushy eyebrows, and said: &ldquo;It is time enough
to-morrow. I will show her to you myself, and
you will see quite enough of her,&rdquo; and he went
off and left the Prince to his sleep.</p>

<p>But next morning, early, the Giant strode into
the Prince&#8217;s room, and saying, &ldquo;Now I will take
you to see the Master-Maid,&rdquo; he opened the door
of the fourth room, beckoned the Prince to follow
him in, and said to the maiden: &ldquo;Kill this youth,
boil him in the large cauldron, and when the broth
is ready, call me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, just as if he had said nothing more startling
than &ldquo;Prepare some cauliflower for dinner,&rdquo;
he lay down on the bench and fell so fast asleep
that his snores sounded like thunder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img182.jpg" width="500" height="378" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;kill this youth. boil him in the large cauldron,&rdquo; said the giant</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately the maiden began to make her
preparations very neatly and quickly. First, with
a little knife she made a small gash in the Prince&#8217;s
little finger and dropped three drops of his blood
on the wooden stool, near the cauldron. Then
she gathered up a lot of rubbish, such as old shoes
and rags, and put them in the cauldron with water
and pepper and salt. Last of all, she packed a
small chest with gold, and gave it to the Prince
to carry; filled a water-flask; took a golden cock
and hen, and put a lump of salt and a golden
apple in her pocket. Then the maid and the
Prince ran to the sea-shore as fast as they could,
climbed on board a little ship that had come from
no-one-knows-where, and sailed away.</p>

<p>After a while the Giant roused a little, and
said sleepily: &ldquo;Will it soon boil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first drop of blood answered quietly: &ldquo;It
is just beginning.&rdquo; And the Giant went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>At the end of a few hours more he roused again
and asked: &ldquo;Will it soon be ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the second drop said: &ldquo;Half done,&rdquo; in
the maiden&#8217;s mournful voice, for she had seen so
many dark deeds done that, until the Prince came,
she was always sad.</p>

<p>Again the Giant went to sleep, for several
hours; but then he became quite awake, and
asked: &ldquo;Is it not done yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third drop said: &ldquo;Quite ready.&rdquo; And the
Giant sat up, and looked around. The maiden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
was nowhere to be seen, but the Giant went over
to the pot and tasted the soup.</p>

<p>At once he knew what had happened, and in
a furious rage rushed to the sea, but he could
not get over it. So he called up his water-sucker,
who lay down and drank two or three draughts;
and the water fell so low that the horizon dropped,
and the Giant could see the maiden and the
Prince a long way off.</p>

<p>But the Master-Maid told the Prince to throw
the lump of salt into the sea, and as soon as he
did so it became such a high mountain that the
Giant could not cross it, and the water-sucker
could not gather up any more water.</p>

<p>Then the Giant called his hill-borer, who bored
a tunnel through the mountain, so that the sucker
could go through and drink up more water.</p>

<p>Then the maiden told the Prince to scatter a
few drops from the water-bottle into the sea. As
soon as he did so the sea filled up, and before
the water-sucker could drink one drop, they were
at the other side, safe in the kingdom of the
Prince&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>The Prince did not think it was fitting that his
bride should walk to his palace, so he said he
would go and fetch seven horses and a carriage
to take her there. The maiden begged him not to
go, because, she said, he would forget her; but
he insisted. Then she asked him to speak to no
one while he was away, and on no account to
taste anything; and he promised that he would go
straight to the stable for the horses, and without
speaking a word to anyone, would come straight
back.</p>

<p>When he got to the palace he found it full of
a merry company, for his brother was going to be
married to a lovely princess, who had come from
a far-off land. But in answer to their cries of
welcome and questions the Prince said no word,
and only shook his head when they offered him
food, until the pretty laughing young sister of the
bride-to-be rolled a bright red apple across the
courtyard to him. Laughing back at her, he
picked it up, and without thinking bit into it.
Immediately he forgot the Master-Maid, who had
saved his life and was now sitting alone on the
seashore waiting for him.</p>

<p>She waited until the night began to grow dark;
then she went away into the wood near the palace
to find shelter. There she found a dark hut,
owned by a Witch, who at first would not allow
her to stay. The Witch&#8217;s hard heart, however,
was softened by the maiden&#8217;s gold, and she allowed
her to have the hut.</p>

<p>Then the maid flung into the fire a handful of
gold, which immediately melted and boiled all
over the hut, and gilded the dark, dingy walls.
The Witch was so frightened that she ran away,
and the maid was left alone in the little gilded
house.</p>

<p>The next morning the Sheriff was passing
through the wood, and stopped to see the gilded
house. At once he fell in love with the beautiful
maiden, and asked her to marry him. The maiden
asked if he had a great deal of money, and the
Sheriff said he had a good deal, and went away to
fetch it. In the evening he came back with a
two-bushel bag of gold; and as he had so much,
the maiden seemed to think she would marry him.</p>

<p>But as they were talking she sprang up, saying
she had forgotten to put coal on the fire. The
Sheriff went to do it for her, and immediately
she put a spell on him so that until morning came,
he could not let the shovel go, and had to stand all
night pouring red hot coals over himself. In the
morning he was a sad sight to see, and hurried
home so fast, to hide himself, that people thought
he was mad.</p>

<p>The next day the Attorney passed by, and the
same thing happened. The Attorney brought a
four-bushel sack of money to show the maid how
rich he was; and while they were talking the maid
said she had forgotten to close the door, so the
Attorney went to close it. When he had his hand
on the latch the maid cried: &ldquo;May you hold the
door, and the door you, and may you go between
wall and wall, till day dawns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all night long the Attorney had to rush
back and forth, trying to escape from the blows
of the door which he could not let go. He made
a great deal of noise, but the maid slept as soundly
as if she were in the midst of calm. In the morning
the Attorney escaped, and went home so
bruised-and-battered looking that everyone stopped
and stared at him.</p>

<p>The next day the Bailiff saw the bright little
house and the maid. He at once fell in love with
her, and brought at least six bushels of money
to show how rich she would be, if she married
him. The maid seemed to think she would; but
while they were talking she suddenly remembered
to tie up the calf.</p>

<p>The Bailiff went to do it for her, and she put a
spell on him, so that all night long he had to fly
over hill and dale holding on to the calf&#8217;s tail,
which he could by no means let go. In the morning
he was a sorry sight, as he limped slowly
home, with torn coat and ragged boots at which
everyone looked, for he was always dressed very
neatly.</p>

<p>While all this was happening, the Prince had
quite forgotten the maid; and, indeed, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
arranged that he was to marry the young Princess
who had thrown him the apple on the same day
that his brother married her sister.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img184.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the bailiff could not let go of the calf&#8217;s tail</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But when the two Princes and their brides
were seated in the carriage the trace-pin broke,
and no pin could be got that would not break,
until the Sheriff thought of the maiden&#8217;s shovel-handle.
The King sent to borrow it, and it made
a pin that did not break in two.</p>

<p>Then a curious thing happened: the bottom of
the carriage fell out, and as fast as a new one
was made it fell to pieces. However, the Attorney
thought of the maiden&#8217;s door. The King sent
to borrow it, and it fitted the bottom of the carriage
exactly.</p>

<p>Everything was now ready, and the coachman
cracked his whip; but, strain as they would, the
horses could not move the carriage. At last the
Bailiff thought of the Master-Maid&#8217;s calf; and
although it was a very ridiculous thing to see
the King&#8217;s carriage drawn by a calf, the King
sent to borrow it. The maiden, who was very
obliging, lent it at once. The calf was harnessed
to the carriage, and away it went over stock and
stone, pulling horse and carriage as easily and
quickly as it had pulled the Bailiff.</p>

<p>When they got to the church door the carriage
began to go round and round so quickly that it
was very difficult and dangerous to get out of it.</p>

<p>When they were seated at the wedding feast,
the Prince said he thought they ought to invite
the maiden who lived in the gilded hut, because
without her help they could not have got to the
church at all. The King thought so too; so they
sent five courtiers to ask her to the feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greet the King,&rdquo; replied the maid, &ldquo;and tell
him if he is too good to come to me, I am too
good to go to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the King had to go himself and invite her;
and as they went to the palace he thought she
was something else than what she seemed to be.</p>

<p>So he put her in the place of honor beside the
Prince; and after a while the Master-Maid took
out the golden cock and hen and the golden apple,
which she had brought from the Giant&#8217;s house,
and put them on the table.</p>

<p>At once the cock and hen began to fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! look how those two there are fighting
for the apple,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so did we fight to get out of danger,&rdquo;
said the Master-Maid.</p>

<p>Then the Prince knew her again. The Witch
who had thrown him the apple disappeared, and
now for the first time they began really to keep
the wedding.</p>

<h2>CAP O&#8217; RUSHES<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></h2>


<p>Well, there was once a very rich gentleman
who had three daughters, and he thought he&#8217;d
see how fond they were of him. So he says to
the first:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you love me, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;as I love my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s good,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>So he says to the second: &ldquo;How much do you
love me, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;better nor all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s good,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>So he says to the third: &ldquo;How much do you
love me, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt,&rdquo;
says she.</p>

<p>Well, but he was angry! &ldquo;You don&#8217;t love me
at all,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and in my house you stay no
more.&rdquo; So he drove her out, there and then,
and shut the door in her face.</p>

<p>Well, she went away, on and on, till she came
to a fen, and there she gathered a lot of rushes
and made them into a kind of a sort of a cloak,
with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and
to hide her fine clothes.</p>

<p>And then she went on and on till she came
to a great house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want a maid?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&#8217;t,&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t nowhere to go,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;and I
ask no wages, and will do any sort of work,&rdquo;
says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;if you like to wash the
pots and scrape the saucepans you may stay,&rdquo;
said they.</p>

<p>So she stayed there, and washed the pots, and
scraped the saucepans, and did all the dirty work.
And because she gave no name they called her
&ldquo;Cap o&#8217; Rushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, one day there was to be a great dance
a little way off, and the servants were allowed
to go and look on at the grand people. Cap o&#8217;
Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed
at home.</p>

<p>But when they were gone, she offed with her cap
o&#8217; rushes, and cleaned herself, and went to the
dance. And no one there was so finely dressed
as she!</p>

<p>Well, who should be there but her master&#8217;s son,
and what should he do but fall in love with her
the minute he set eyes on her. He wouldn&#8217;t
dance with anyone else.</p>

<p>But before the dance was done, Cap o&#8217; Rushes
slipped off and away she went home. And when
the other maids came back she was pretending
to be asleep with her cap o&#8217; rushes on.</p>

<p>Well, next morning they said to her: &ldquo;You
did miss a sight, Cap o&#8217; Rushes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the beautifullest lady you ever saw,
dressed right gay and ga&#8217;. The young master&mdash;he
never took his eyes off her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to have seen her,&rdquo; says
Cap o&#8217; Rushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&#8217;s to be another dance this evening,
and perhaps she&#8217;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, come the evening, Cap o&#8217; Rushes said she
was too tired to go with them. Howsoever, when
they were gone, she offed with her cap o&#8217; rushes,
cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance.</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s son had been reckoning on seeing
her, and he danced with no one else, and never
took his eyes off her. But before the dance was
over she slipped off and home she went, and when
the maids came back she pretended to be asleep
with her cap o&#8217; rushes on.</p>

<p>Next day they said to her again: &ldquo;Well, Cap
o&#8217; Rushes, you should have been there to see the
lady. There she was again, gay and ga&#8217;, and the
young master&mdash;he never took his eyes off her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I should ha&#8217; liked to
ha&#8217; seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says they, &ldquo;there&#8217;s a dance again this
evening, and you must go with us, for she&#8217;s
sure to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, come this evening, Cap o&#8217; Rushes said
she was too tired to go; and do what they would
she stayed at home. But when they were gone,
she offed with her cap o&#8217; rushes and cleaned herself,
and away she went to the dance.</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s son was rarely glad when he saw
her. He danced with none but her, and never
took his eyes off her. When she wouldn&#8217;t tell
him her name, nor where she came from, he gave
her a ring, and told her if he didn&#8217;t see her
again he should die.</p>

<p>Well, before the dance was over, off she slipped,
and home she went; and when the maids came
home she was pretending to be asleep with her
cap o&#8217; rushes on.</p>

<p>Well, next day they says to her: &ldquo;There, Cap
o&#8217; Rushes, you didn&#8217;t come last night, and now
you won&#8217;t see the lady, for there&#8217;s no more
dances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should have rarely liked to have seen
her,&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s son he tried every way to find
out where the lady was gone; but go where he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
might, and ask whom he might, he never heard
anything about her. And he got worse and worse
for the love of her, till he had to keep to his bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make some gruel for the young master,&rdquo; they
said to the cook. &ldquo;He&#8217;s dying for the love of
the lady.&rdquo; The cook set about making it, when
Cap o&#8217; Rushes came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you a-doing of?&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m going to make some gruel for the young
master,&rdquo; says the cook, &ldquo;for he&#8217;s dying for love
of the lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me make it,&rdquo; says Cap o&#8217; Rushes.</p>

<p>Well, the cook wouldn&#8217;t at first, but at last
she said yes, and Cap o&#8217; Rushes made the gruel.
And when she had made it she slipped the ring
into it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs.</p>

<p>The young man he drank it, and then he saw
the ring at the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send for the cook,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>So up she came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who made this gruel here?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; says the cook, for she was frightened.</p>

<p>And he looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Say who did it,
and you shan&#8217;t be harmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, &#8217;t was Cap o&#8217; Rushes,&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send Cap o&#8217; Rushes here,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>So Cap o&#8217; Rushes came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you make my gruel?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this ring?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From him that gave it me,&rdquo; says she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, then?&rdquo; says the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll show you,&rdquo; says she. And she offed with
her cap o&#8217; rushes, and there she was in her
beautiful clothes.</p>

<p>Well, the master&#8217;s son he got well very soon,
and they were to be married in a little time. It
was to be a very grand wedding, and everyone
was asked, far and near. And Cap o&#8217; Rushes&#8217;
father was asked. But she never told anybody
who she was.</p>

<p>But before the wedding, she went to the cook,
and says she:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to dress every dish without a mite
of salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;ll be rare nasty,&rdquo; says the cook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;and there she was in her beautiful clothes&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&#8217;t signify,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Well, the wedding day came, and they were
married. And after they were married all the
company sat down to the dinner. When they began
to eat the meat, it was so tasteless they
couldn&#8217;t eat it. But Cap o&#8217; Rushes&#8217; father tried
first one dish and then another, and then he burst
out crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter?&rdquo; said the master&#8217;s son to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I had a daughter. And I
asked her how much she loved me. And she said,
&lsquo;As much as fresh meat loves salt.&rsquo; And I turned
her from my door, for I thought she didn&#8217;t love
me. And now I see she loved me best of all.
And she may be dead for aught I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, father, here she is!&rdquo; said Cap o&#8217; Rushes.
And she goes up to him and puts her arms round
him.</p>

<p>And so they were all happy ever after.</p></div>

<h2><a name="FULFILLED" id="FULFILLED"></a>FULFILLED</h2>


<p>It was Christmas eve, and in the great house
on the hill there was much rejoicing and preparation
for the feasting on the morrow. A knock
came at the door, and two strangers stood there.
&ldquo;We have lost our way,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and the night
is dark and cold, and we do not know where to
go, and we would be glad to be allowed to stay
for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the farmer and his wife said &ldquo;No!&rdquo; very
shortly. They had no room for beggars.</p>

<p>So the strangers went to the foot of the hill
where stood the small cottage of a laborer and
his wife. In this house there was much happiness,
but there was no preparation for feasting
on the morrow. They were poor folk, who could
not keep the feast.</p>

<p>But when the strangers came the laborer opened
the door wide and bade them enter and draw near
the fire and warm themselves. And, because
there was but one bed in the house, the laborer
and his wife gave that to their guests, and themselves
slept on straw in an outer room; but,
strange to say, they never slept better in all their
lives.</p>

<p>In the morning they urged the strangers to
stay with them, as it was a feast-day, and a sorry
time for travelers to be on the road. And,
because there was no meat in the house, the
laborer went out and killed the one goat which
they owned, and his wife dressed it, and cooked
it, and made a feast. Then the strangers and
the laborer and his wife went to church together,
and all came home and sat down to the good
dinner.</p>

<p>And when they were departing one of the
strangers said to the laborer: &ldquo;How many horns
had the little goat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laborer looked a bit confused, for he had
not meant that his guests should know that he
had sacrificed his last goat for them, but he
answered: &ldquo;Why, there were but two, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the guests, &ldquo;you and your wife
shall have two wishes, one for each of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laborer and his wife looked at each other,
at first in perplexity, and then they smiled. They
were very contented, they said. They had looked
into each other&#8217;s eyes, and had seen that which
made for happiness and contentment. So they
told the guests that they had no wishes to make:
if they might but have their daily bread, and the
hope of heaven when they died, there was nothing
more.</p>

<p>The strangers said that these things should
certainly be fulfilled, and took their leave, promising
to come again next year, and spend the
night, and attend church, and share the feast
with their friends.</p>

<p>From that day on everything that the laborer
and his wife did prospered. Their pigs were fat,
and brought good prices on the market; their
corn grew thick and tall, and the barns were filled
with golden grain; their hens laid more and bigger
eggs than ever before, so that soon the couple
were no longer poor, but prosperous.</p>

<p>They knew quite well to whom they owed such
good fortune, and often spoke about it, and looked
forward to the time when their friends should
come again next year. For it seemed to them that
they could hardly enjoy the good things that had
been given to them until they had thanked those
through whose favor the good fortune had come.</p>

<p>Now, the farmer and his wife remembered that
these strangers had first come to them; and when
they heard the story they were envious, for, although
they were rich, they were not content.</p>

<p>So one day the farmer went down the hill to
the laborer&#8217;s cottage and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, your house is but small to entertain
such guests. When they come again this year,
send them up to our house, and we will give them
a grand feast, and soft beds to sleep on, and take
them to the church in our fine carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laborer and his wife thought that it was
very nice that their friends were to be so well
entertained, and were very willing to promise to
send them to the house of the farmer.</p>

<p>So when the Christmas season was come the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
farmer and his wife killed an ox, and prepared
a great feast. And when the strangers came they
were right royally entertained; but the next morning
they said that they must hasten, as they were
to enter the church with the friends of the year
before. This was very satisfactory to the farmer
and his wife, for they did not want to go to
church on Christmas Day, but the farmer said
that since the strangers were going to the church
he would drive them there in his carriage.</p>

<p>So the finest horses on the farm were harnessed
to the carriage and it stood at the door. And just
as they were about to drive away one of the
strangers turned to the farmer, asking: &ldquo;Did you
kill the ox for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered the farmer, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how many horns did he have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the question that the farmer and his
wife had been waiting for, and the farmer&#8217;s wife
whispered in her husband&#8217;s ear: &ldquo;Say four&mdash;there
will be that much more for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the farmer answered: &ldquo;Indeed, it was a
very peculiar ox; it had four horns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;you shall have four
wishes, two for each of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they mounted into the carriage and were
driven off to the church, the farmer driving very
fast, for he was eager to get back home to his
wife so that they might talk over what they were
to wish for.</p>

<p>So when he started back the horses were pretty
well &ldquo;blown,&rdquo; and could not go fast, and the
farmer whipped them, and at last one of them
stumbled and a trace broke. This was most provoking,
and he could not wait to fix it right, but
fastened it hastily, for he wanted to be at home
again. Then the other horse stumbled, and the
other trace broke, so both of them were down.</p>

<p>At this the farmer was very angry. &ldquo;The
wicked elves take you! I wish&mdash;&rdquo; But the words
were not all out of his mouth before the horses
had gone, leaving the harness dangling to the
carriage.</p>

<p>The farmer was indeed angry now, but there
was nothing to be done about it, and he knew
that he had but one wish left and he wanted to
make that one very carefully, so he packed the
harness on his back, left the wagon standing, and
started home on foot.</p>

<p>Now, at home the farmer&#8217;s wife was very impatient
for him to come, for she wanted to talk
over with him what her two wishes should be,
and at last she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, I wish that he
would hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner were the words spoken than the
farmer shot through the air and into the house,
angry at having been brought so speedily, and
at his wife for having so foolishly wasted a wish.
So immediately they began to quarrel about it,
and the farmer said that it was all her fault for
making him lie about the number of horns on
the ox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plague take the woman!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
wish that two of the horns were growing out of
her head this minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner were the words spoken than the
woman threw her hands to her head and cried
aloud in pain, for two horns were growing rapidly,
one on each side of her head, and soon they
were pushing through her hair and shoving her
cap aside.</p>

<p>But the farmer clapped his hand to his mouth
exclaiming: &ldquo;Oh, that was my last wish. Do
you now quickly wish for a million dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much good a million dollars would do me!&rdquo;
said his wife, &ldquo;with horns on my head like an
ox!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you could buy bonnets of silk and of
velvet and cover them up,&rdquo; pleaded her husband,
who saw his last hope of riches disappearing, as,
indeed, it did, for he had hardly stopped speaking
when his wife exclaimed: &ldquo;I wish that the horns
were gone off of my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment the horns were gone, and
so was the last wish, and so was the hope for
great riches, and so, also, were the two fine
horses!</p>

<h2><a name="GRISLY" id="GRISLY"></a>KING GRISLY-BEARD</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD FROM THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>Once there was a great King who had a daughter
that was very beautiful, but so haughty and
vain she thought none of the Princes who came
to ask her in marriage were good enough for
her, and she made sport of them.</p>

<p>One day the King, her father, held a great
feast, and invited all the Princes at once. They
sat in a row, according to their rank&mdash;Kings and
Princes and Dukes and Earls. Then the Princess
came in, and passed down the line by them all;
but she had something disagreeable to say to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
every one. The first was too fat. &ldquo;He&#8217;s as
round as a tub!&rdquo; she said. The next one was
too tall. &ldquo;What a flag-pole!&rdquo; she declared. The
next was too short. &ldquo;What a dumpling!&rdquo; was
her comment. The fourth was too pale, and so
she called him &ldquo;Wall-face.&rdquo; The fifth was too
red, and was named &ldquo;Coxcomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus she had some joke upon every one, but
she laughed more than all at a good King who
was there. &ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;his beard
is like an old mop. I call him &lsquo;Grisly-Beard.&rsquo;&rdquo;
So after that the good King got the nickname of
&ldquo;Grisly-Beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the old King, her father, was very angry
when he saw how badly his daughter behaved,
and how she treated all his friends. So he said
that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the
first beggar that came to the door! All the Kings
and Nobles heard him say this.</p>

<p>Two days afterward a traveling singer came
by. When he began to sing and beg alms the
King heard him and said: &ldquo;Let him come in.&rdquo;
So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow, and
he sang before the King and the Princess. When
he begged a gift the King said: &ldquo;You have sung
so well that I will give you my daughter for your
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img189.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;you have sung so well i will give you my daughter for your wife&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Princess begged for mercy, but her father
said: &ldquo;I shall keep my word.&rdquo; So the parson
was sent for, and she was married to the singer.
Then the King said: &ldquo;You must get ready; you
can&#8217;t stay here any longer; you must travel on
with your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the beggar departed and took his wife
with him.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a great wood. &ldquo;Whose wood
is this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs to King Grisly-Beard,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If
you had taken him this would have been yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, unlucky girl that I am! I wish I had
taken King Grisly-Beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next they came to some fine meadows. &ldquo;Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They belong to King Grisly-Beard. If you
had taken him they would have been yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, unlucky girl that I am! I wish indeed I
had married King Grisly-Beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they came to a great city. &ldquo;Whose is this
noble city?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs to King Grisly-Beard,&rdquo; he said
again. &ldquo;If you had taken him this would have
been yours, also.&rdquo;</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/img190.jpg" width="184" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a drunken soldier rode his horse against her stall</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, miserable girl that I am,&rdquo; she sighed.
&ldquo;Why did I not marry King Grisly-Beard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no business of mine,&rdquo; said the singer.</p>

<p>At last they came to a small cottage. &ldquo;To
whom does this little hovel belong?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is yours and mine,&rdquo; said the beggar.
&ldquo;This is where we are to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are your servants?&rdquo; she asked, falteringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot afford servants,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
will have to do whatever is to be done. Now,
make the fire and put on water and cook my
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess knew nothing of making fires and
cooking, and the beggar was forced to help her.
Early the next morning he called her to clean
the house.</p>

<p>Thus they lived for three days, and when they
had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man
said: &ldquo;Wife, we can&#8217;t go on like this, spending
money and earning nothing. You must learn to
weave baskets.&rdquo; So he went out and cut willows,
and brought them home and taught her how to
weave. But it made her fingers very sore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that this will never do,&rdquo; said her husband;
&ldquo;try and spin. Perhaps you will do that
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she sat down and tried to spin, and her
husband tried to teach her; but the threads cut
her tender fingers till the blood ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are good for nothing,&rdquo; said
the man. &ldquo;What a bargain I have got. However,
I will try and set up a trade in pots and
pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed she, &ldquo;when I stand in the market,
if any of my father&#8217;s court pass by and see
me there, how they will laugh at me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the beggar said she must work, if she did
not wish to die of hunger. At first, the trade
went very well, for many people, seeing such a
beautiful woman, bought her wares and paid their
money without thinking of taking away the goods.
Then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware,
and she sat down one day with it in the corner
of the market; but a drunken soldier came by
and rode his horse against her stall, and broke
her goods into a thousand pieces. So she began
to weep: &ldquo;Ah, what will become of me?&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;What will my husband say?&rdquo; So she ran
home and told him all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How silly you were,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to put a china-stall
in the corner of the market where everybody
passes; but let us have no more crying.
I see you are not fit for this sort of work; so I
will go to the King&#8217;s palace and ask if they do not
want a kitchen-maid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next day the Princess became a kitchen-maid,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and helped the cook do all the dirtiest work.</p>

<p>She had not been there long before she heard
that the eldest son of the King of that country
was going to be married. She looked out of one
of the windows and saw all the ladies and gentlemen
of the court in fine array. Then she thought
with a sore heart of her own sad fate. Her husband,
it is true, had been in a way kind to her;
but she realized now the pride and folly which
had brought her so low.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as she was going out to take
some food to her husband in their humble cottage,
the King&#8217;s son in golden clothes broke through
the crowd; and when he saw a beautiful woman
at the kitchen door, he took her by the hand and
said that she should be his partner in the dance.</p>

<p>Then she trembled for fear, for when she looked
up she saw that it was King Grisly-Beard himself
who was making fun of her. However, he led
her into the ballroom, and as he did so the cover
of her basket came off, so that the fragments of
food in it fell to the floor. Then everybody
laughed and jeered at her, and she wished herself
a thousand feet deep in the earth.</p>

<p>She sprang to the door to run away; but King
Grisly-Beard overtook her, brought her back, and
threw his golden cloak over her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid, my dear,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am
the beggar who has lived with you in the hut.
I brought you there because I loved you. I am
also the soldier who upset your stall. I have
done all this to cure you of your pride. Now it
is all over; you have learned wisdom, and it is
time for us to hold our marriage feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the maids came and brought her the most
beautiful robes, and her father and his whole
court came in and wished her much happiness.
The feast was grand, and all were merry; and
I wish you and I had been of the party.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and the Town Rat</span></strong></em></p>


<p>A Country Rat invited a Town Rat, an intimate friend,
to pay him a visit, and partake of his country fare. As
they were on the bare plough-lands, eating their wheat-stalks
and roots pulled up from the hedge row, the Town
Rat said to his friend, &ldquo;You live here the life of the ants,
while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded
with every luxury, and if you will come with me, as I
much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of
my dainties.&rdquo; The Country Rat was easily persuaded, and
returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the Town
Rat placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey,
raisins, and last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from
a basket. The Country Rat being much delighted at the
sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm
terms, and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were
beginning to eat, some one opened the door, and they both
ran off squeaking as fast as they could to a hole so narrow
that two could only find room in it by squeezing. They had
scarcely again begun their repast when someone else entered
to take something out of a cupboard, on which the two
Rats, more frightened than before, ran away and hid themselves.
At last the Country Rat, almost famished, thus
addressed his friend: &ldquo;Although you have prepared for me
so dainty a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by
yourself. It is surrounded by too many dangers to
please me. I prefer my bare plough-lands and
roots from the hedge row, so that I only
can live in safety and without fear.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE FOX AND THE GOAT</h2>


<p>A Fox one day tried to drink at a well when
he caught his feet on a stone and fell into the
water. It was not so deep as to drown him, yet
the poor Fox could not get out. Soon a Goat
came that way. He, too, thought he would drink,
but then he saw the Fox in the well, so he said,
&ldquo;Is the water good?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Fox,
&ldquo;it is very good and nice, and there is a lot of it.&rdquo;
In sprang the Goat, and at once the Fox sprang
on to his back, and thence out of the well. &ldquo;Ah,
my friend!&rdquo; said he, as he stood safe on the
brink, &ldquo;if your brains had been as large as
your beard, you would have seen where you
meant to jump to!&rdquo; and then the sly Fox ran
off and left the poor Goat in the well. <em>Look

<h2><a name="FROGS" id="FROGS"></a>THE TWO FROGS</h2>


<p>Two Frogs were neighbors. The one inhabited
a deep pond, far removed from public view; the
other lived in a gully containing little water, and
traversed by a country road. He that lived in the
pond warned his friend, and entreated him to
change his residence and come and live with him,
saying that he could enjoy greater safety from
danger and more abundant food. The other refused,
saying that he felt it so very hard to remove
from a place to which he had become accustomed.
A few days afterward a heavy wagon
passed through the gully, and crushed him to
death under its wheels. <em>A wilful man will have

<p>A cross Dog lay in a manger full of hay; and
when the Ox came near to eat his own food, the

<h2><a name="STAG" id="STAG"></a>THE STAG AT THE POOL</h2>


<p>One hot day, a Stag, who came down from the
hills to quench his thirst at a pool of clear water,
saw his form in the stream. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what fine horns these are&mdash;with what grace do
they rise above my head! I wish that all the
parts of my body were as good as they. But
sometimes I quite blush at these poor, thin, weak
legs of mine.&rdquo; While he thought thus, all at
once the cries of the huntsman and the bay of
the hounds were heard. Away flew the Stag, and
by the aid of these same thin, weak legs he soon
outran the hunt. At last he found himself in a
wood, and he had the bad luck to catch his fine
horns in the branch of a tree, where he was held
till the hounds came up and caught him. He now
saw how foolish he had been in thinking so ill
of his legs which would have brought him safely
away, and in being so vain of those horns which
had caused his ruin. <em>The useful is better than

<h2><a name="ASS" id="ASS"></a>THE WAR-HORSE AND THE ASS</h2>


<p>A War-Horse, grand in all the trappings of
war, came with a great noise down the road. The
ground rang with the sound of his hoofs. At
the same time a meek Ass went with tired step
down the same road with a great load on his back.
The Horse cried to the poor Ass to &ldquo;get out of
my way, or I will crush you beneath my feet.&rdquo;
The Ass, who did not wish to make the proud
horse cross, at once went to the side, so that he
might pass him. Not long after this, the Horse
was sent to the wars. There he had the ill-luck
to get a bad wound, and in that state, as he was
not fit to serve in the field of war, his fine clothes
were taken from him, and he was sold to the man
with whom the Ass dwelt. Thus the Ass and the
Horse met once more, but this time the grand
War-Horse was, with great pains and toil, drawing
a cart with a load of bricks. Then the Ass
saw what small cause he had to think his lot
worse than that of the Horse, who had in times
gone by treated him with so much scorn. <em>Pride

<h2><a name="WHO" id="WHO"></a>THE FROGS WHO WANTED A KING</h2>


<p>In old times when the Frogs swam at ease
through the ponds and lakes, they grew tired of
their tame mode of life. They thought they would
like some kind of change, so they all met and
with much noise prayed to Jove to send them a
King. Jove and all the gods laughed loud at the
Frogs, and with a view to please them he threw to
them a log, and said, &ldquo;There is a King for you!&rdquo;
The loud fall of the log made a great splash in
the lake, which sent a thrill through all the Frogs;
and it was long ere they dared to take a peep
at their new lord and King. At length some of
the more brave swam to him, and they were soon
followed by the rest; and when they saw that he
did not move but lay quite still, they leaped upon
his back, and sprang and sang on him, and cried
out that he was no King but a log. Such a
King did not at all please them; so they sent a
fresh prayer to Jove to beg him for a King who
had some life, and would move. Then Jove sent
a Stork, and said he thought this would suit
them. The Stork had but just come to the Frogs
than he set to work to eat them up as fast as he
could. Of course the Frogs did not like this new
King even as well as King Log, and they sent at
once to Jove and prayed to him to take away
the Stork. They would rather have no King at
all than all be eaten up. But Jove would not
grant their prayer this time. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
was your own wish, and if you will be so vain
and foolish, you must pay the cost.&rdquo; <em>It is better
to bear the ills we have than fly to those we
know not of.</em></p>

<h2>THE SHEPHERD BOY AND THE WOLF</h2>


<p>A Shepherd Boy, who tended his sheep in a
field near a village, used to make fun of his
friends by crying out now and then, &ldquo;A Wolf! a
Wolf!&rdquo; as if a Wolf were at the heels of his
sheep. This trick did well more than once. The
men who were in the village would leave their
work, and come in hot haste to the boy&#8217;s help,
each man with an axe or a club with which to
kill the Wolf. But as each time they found that
it was a Boy&#8217;s joke, they made up their minds
not to come at his cries. One day the Wolf did
come; and the Boy cried and cried, &ldquo;The Wolf!
The Wolf! Help! Help!&rdquo; But it was all in
vain, each man thought he was at his old game
again. So the Wolf ate the poor Sheep. <em>No one

<p>An Ass and a Cock one day ate together just

cast his eyes on the Ass, he made up his mind to
make a meal of him. But it is said that the Lion,
though he is the King of Beasts, dreads to hear
a cock crow. Now, it came to pass that, just
as the Lion was in the act of springing on the
Ass, the Cock sent forth a loud and shrill crow.
The Lion took to his heels at once, and ran off as
fast as he could. The Ass saw this, and thought
that the Lion was running off through fear of
him. So he gave a great bray, and threw up his
head, and started to chase the runaway King of
Beasts. But they had not gone far in this way
when the Lion turned round. He soon saw that
there was but an Ass behind him; so he stood still
in his flight, laid hold of the poor Ass, and soon
tore him to pieces. <em>Pride oft leads to ruin.</em></p>

the first to catch sight of it. &ldquo;No! to me,&rdquo; said
the Lion; &ldquo;am I not the King of Beasts?&rdquo; As
they could not agree as to who should own the
body of the Fawn, they fell to blows. The fight
was hard and long; and at last both were so faint
and weak with loss of blood that they lay down
on the ground and panted, for they were quite out
of breath. Just then a Fox went by, and saw
that the Bear and the Lion had no strength left,
so he quickly stepped in between them and bore
off the Fawn as his prize. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;how
foolish we have been! The end of all our fighting
has been to give that sly scamp the Fox a good
meal.&rdquo; <em>Half a loaf is better than no bread.</em></p>

Horse consented and allowed the man to mount

go, and then the Dogs took the Kid home to her

A raven having stolen a bit of cheese, perched in a

to possess himself of the cheese, and by wily stratagem
succeeded. &ldquo;How handsome is the raven,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;in the beauty of her shape, and in the fairness of her
complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to her
beauty, she would deservedly be considered the
Queen of the birds!&rdquo; This he said
deceitfully; but the raven, anxious
to refute the reflection cast upon
her voice, set up a loud caw, and
dropped the cheese. The fox quickly
picked it up, and thus addressed
the raven: &ldquo;My good raven, your voice
is right enough, but your wit is wanting.&rdquo;</p>

went in this way by a long, long road, the poor
tired Ass tried to get the Horse to help him to
bear his load. But the Horse was not kind, and
said lots of cruel things to the Ass and said he
must trudge on in front. The Ass did trudge on;
but the weight was too much for him, so he fell
down on the road, and at once died. The man
then came up, took the load from the back of the
Ass, and laid it on that of the Horse; and made

<p>A Man who had an Ass heard that salt was to

he was, so he went there to buy some. He put
as much on his Ass as he could bear, and was
going home, when just as they had to cross a
small bridge, the Ass fell into the stream; the
salt at once melted, so the Ass with ease got up
the bank, and, now free from his load, went on
his way with a light heart. Very soon after this
the man went to the seaside once more, and put
still more salt on his Ass. As they went their
way they came once more to the bridge where the
Ass fell into the stream. The Ass thought of his
fall and what had come of it, and this time took
care to roll into the water once more; the salt
was again gone, and he was free from his load.
The Man was cross at this, and thought to cure
the Ass of this trick, so the third time he gave
him a load of sponges. As soon as they came
to the bridge the Ass fell into the stream; but
as the sponges drew in the water he found as he
trudged home that this time his load had grown
in weight. <em>We may play a trick once too often.</em></p>

<h2>THE DOG AND THE ASS</h2>


<p>An Ass laden with loaves of bread was going
on a long journey with a dog to guard him from
harm. Before the journey was ended both were
famished with hunger, which the Ass was able
to appease by eating the grass and thistles that
grew by the roadside. Seeing this, the dog&#8217;s hunger
became still sharper, so that he begged for
a piece of bread from the Ass&#8217;s load.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are hungry,&rdquo; said the Ass rudely, &ldquo;you
can eat grass just as I do. I have no bread
to give you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they saw, in the distance, a Wolf
loping toward them, and the trembling Ass begged
the dog to protect him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the dog. &ldquo;People who live alone
will have to fight alone.&rdquo; And he went off and
left the unfortunate Ass to his fate.</p>

Wind began, by blowing a strong blast, thinking
to tear away the traveler&#8217;s cloak. But his breath
was so cold, that he only succeeded in making the
traveler wind his garment more and more closely
around him, until he resembled a sheath.</p>

<p>Then came the Sun&#8217;s turn, and he shed his
beams on the poor man&#8217;s head so that he loosened
his cloak, and basked in their warmth, and finally
quite forgetful of the cold, he cast his cloak
aside and took shelter from the heat under a tree
that grew by the roadside.</p>

dispute arose between them as to which had
the right to it. The owner maintained that he

But at last a young mouse plucked up his spirits
and said: &ldquo;I will tell you what to do. Fasten
a bell on the cat&#8217;s neck. As she walks about
the bell will ring, and we shall hear it and can
tell where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed so good a plan that the mice all
chattered joyously, until an old mouse asked
quietly: &ldquo;Who will go out and bell the cat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of the mice dared; and they quickly realized
that <em>what seems an easy plan may be hard
to carry out, and some things are easier said
than done</em>.</p>

<h2>A MILLER, HIS SON,<br />
AND THEIR ASS</h2>


<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
A miller and his son were driving their ass
to a neighboring fair to sell him. They
had not gone far when they met a troop of
women collected around a well. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; cried one,
&ldquo;did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging on
foot when they might ride?&rdquo; The old man, hearing
this, made his son mount, and continued to
walk at his side.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
Presently they came to a group of old men
in debate. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;it proves
what I was a-saying: what respect is shown to
old age in these days? Do you see that idle
lad riding, while his old father has to walk? Get
down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man
rest his weary limbs.&rdquo; Upon this the old man made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
his son dismount, and got up himself.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
Soon they met a company of women and children.
&ldquo;Why, you lazy old fellow,&rdquo; cried several tongues at once,
&ldquo;how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little
lad can hardly keep pace by the side of you?&rdquo; The
miller immediately took up his son behind him. They
had now almost reached the town.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
&ldquo;Pray, honest friend,&rdquo; said a citizen, &ldquo;is that ass your
own?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Oh, one would not have
thought so,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;by the way you load him.
Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the
poor beast than he you.&rdquo; So they tied the legs of the
ass together, and by the aid of a pole endeavored to
carry him on their shoulders over a bridge. The sight
brought the people in crowds to laugh at it; till the
ass broke the cords that held him and fell into
the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed,
made his way home.</p>

<h2>THE TORTOISE AND THE EAGLE</h2>


<p>A Tortoise, lazily basking in the sun, complained
to the sea-birds of her hard fate, that no
one would teach her to fly. An Eagle hovering
near, heard her lamentation, and demanded what
reward she would give him, if he would take her
aloft, and float her in the air. &ldquo;I will give you,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;all the riches of the Red Sea.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
will teach you to fly then,&rdquo; said the Eagle; and
taking her up in his talons, he carried her almost
to the clouds,&mdash;when suddenly letting her go, she
fell on a lofty mountain, and dashed her shell to
pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment
of death: &ldquo;I have deserved my present fate; for
what had I to do with wings and clouds, who can
with difficulty move about on the earth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Peacock made complaint to Juno that,
while the small nightingale pleased every ear with
his song, he no sooner opened his mouth than he
became a laughing-stock of all who heard him.
The Goddess, to console him, said, &ldquo;But you far
excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the
emerald shines in your neck, and you unfold a
tail gorgeous with painted plumage.&rdquo; &ldquo;But for
what purpose have I,&rdquo; said the bird, &ldquo;this dumb
beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
lot of each,&rdquo; replied Juno, &ldquo;has been assigned by
the will of the Fates&mdash;to thee, beauty; to the
eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the
raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable
auguries. These are all contented with the endowments
allotted to them.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ASS" id="THE_ASS"></a>THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE ASS</h2>


<p>The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass entered into an
agreement to assist each other in the chase. Having
secured a large booty, the Lion, on their
return from the forest, asked the Ass to allot his
due portion to each of the three partners in the
treaty. The Ass carefully divided the spoil into
three equal shares, and modestly requested the
two others to make the first choice. The Lion,
bursting into a great rage, devoured the Ass.
Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor
to make a division. The Fox accumulated all that
they had killed into one large heap, and left to
himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion
said, &ldquo;Who has taught you, my very excellent
fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to
a fraction.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I learnt it from the
Ass, by witnessing his fate.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="FATHER" id="FATHER"></a>THE FATHER AND HIS SONS</h2>


<p>A Father had a family of sons who were
perpetually quarreling among themselves. When
he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations,
he determined to give them a practical illustration
of the evils of disunion and for this purpose
he one day told them to bring him a bundle
of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the
faggot into the hands of each of them in succession,
and ordered them to break it in pieces.
They each tried with all their strength and were
not able to do it. He next unclosed the faggot,
and took the sticks separately, one by one, and
again put them into their hands, on which they
broke them easily. He then addressed them in
these words: &ldquo;My sons, if you are of one mind,
and unite to assist each other, you will be as this
faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your
enemies; but <em>if you are divided among yourselves,
you will be broken as easily as these sticks</em>.&rdquo;</p>

An ant went to the bank of a river to quench
its thirst, and, being carried away by the rush
of the stream, was on the point of being drowned.
A dove, sitting on a tree overhanging the water,
plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream close
to her. The ant, climbing on to it, floated in safety
to the bank. Shortly afterward a bird-catcher came
and stood under the tree, and laid his lime-twigs for
the dove, which sat in the branches. The ant, perceiving
his design, stung him in the foot. He suddenly
threw down the twigs, and thereupon made the
dove take wing.</p>

A fox was boasting to a cat of its clever devices for
escaping its enemies. &ldquo;I have a whole bag of tricks,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
&ldquo;I have only one,&rdquo; said the cat, &ldquo;but I can generally manage
with that.&rdquo; Just at that moment they heard the cry of a
pack of hounds coming toward them, and the cat immediately
scampered up a tree and hid himself in the boughs. &ldquo;This
is my plan,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 1.4em;">
The fox thought first of one way, then of another,
and while he was debating, the hounds came nearer,
and at last the fox in his confusion was caught up by
the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen.</p>

<p>Then the Glow-Worm led him to a place in
the wood where a fire had been kindled by some
woodmen, and pointing to the sparks flying about,
said, &ldquo;There you find the Glow-Worms warming
themselves round a fire. When you have done
with them, I shall show you some more, at a distance
from this place.&rdquo;</p>

with all his Hens and Chicks, was also there to
enjoy the sight.</p>

<p>The Fox then got up, and shaking off his
drowsiness, said, &ldquo;I ate a number of Hens and
Chicks last night; hence I must have slumbered
longer than usual.&rdquo;</p>

found a number wanting. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how

<p>A Snake and a Frog were friends in a pond.

taught the Snake to croak. The Snake would
hide in the reeds and croak. The Frogs would
say, &ldquo;Why, there is one of us,&rdquo; and come near.
The Snake would then dart at them, and eat
all he could seize. The Frog would hide in the
reeds and hiss. His kin would say, &ldquo;Why, there
is the Snake,&rdquo; and keep off.</p>

<p>After some time, the Frogs found out the trick
of the Snake, and took care not to come near
him. Thus the Snake got no Frogs to eat for
a long time; so he seized his friend to gobble
him up.</p>

The man rose up in the morning and complained
bitterly to the crowd, which came to see him, that
some one had stolen his two dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Wag, who was one of the crowd,
&ldquo;some one has simply saved you the trouble of
putting the two dogs together, and making a gray
dog of them. So you must now perform the other
part of your trick, and make the black dog and

beyond.&rdquo;</p>

they came to the stream, which was flowing full,
Nimble held back; but Grand Tusk took him up
on his back, and swam across in a very short
time. Then they came to the mango-tree, but
it was very lofty and thick. Grand Tusk could
neither touch the fruit with his trunk, nor could
he break the tree down to gather the fruit. Up
sprang Nimble, and in a trice let drop a whole
basketful of rich ripe mangoes. Grand Tusk
gathered the fruit up into his capacious mouth,
and the two friends crossed the stream as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Dark Sage, &ldquo;which of you is the
better? Grand Tusk crossed the stream, and Nimble
gathered the fruit.&rdquo; <em>Each thing in its place

<p>The latter said to himself, &ldquo;This animal looks
like a Goat, but it does not talk like one. So
it is very likely some wicked spirit in this shape.
Prudence often serves us better than valor, so
for the present I shall return to the wood,&rdquo; and
he turned back.</p>

<p>The Goat rose up, and, advancing to the mouth
of the cave, said, &ldquo;Will you come back to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; said the Lion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I shall be able to see you, at
least, in the wood to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither in the wood, nor in this neighborhood
any more,&rdquo; said the Lion, and running to the
forest, soon left it with his kindred.</p>

<p>The animals in the country, not hearing him
roar any more, gathered round the Goat, and said,
&ldquo;<em>The wisdom of one doth save a host.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SUNLING" id="SUNLING"></a>THE SUNLING</h2>


<p>In the good old days a Clown in the East, on
a visit to a city kinsman, while at dinner, pointed
to a burning candle and asked what it was. The
City Man said, in jest, it was a sunling, or one
of the children of the sun.</p>

<p>The Clown thought that it was something rare;
so he waited for an opportunity, and hid it in a
chest of drawers close by. Soon the chest caught
fire, then the curtains by its side, then the room,
then the whole house.</p>

<p>After the flames had been put down the City
Man and the Clown went into the burned building
to see what remained. The Clown turned over
the embers of the chest of drawers. The City
Man asked what he was seeking for. The Clown
said, &ldquo;It is in this chest that I hid the bright sunling;
I wish to know if he has survived the
flames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said the City Man, who now found out
the cause of all the mischief, &ldquo;<em>never jest with
fools!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A Goose that was once cackling with great

you stare at me like that? You can never hope
to meet me on terms of equality, can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; said the Mushroom &ldquo;and
that very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This enraged the Goose more, so she said, &ldquo;I
would cut you up in pieces with my bill but for
the people who are close by, and who are so silly
as to care for you,&rdquo; and went strutting away.
Soon after the Goose and Mushroom were served
up in separate dishes, very near each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Mushroom, &ldquo;you see we have
met after all, and so closely.&rdquo; <em>Those who have a

<p>A hungry Fox, spying a fine fat Hen, made
up his mind to eat her. But as he was about to
spring upon her he heard a great noise, and looking
up, saw a drum hanging upon a tree. As the
wind blew, the branches beat upon the drum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A thing that can make so
much noise must certainly have more flesh upon
it than a miserable hen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, allowing the Hen to escape, he sprang upon
the drum; but when he tore the parchment head
open he found that there was nothing inside.</p>

home for his net in order that he might catch

little channel that led to a river. The others did
not trouble at all.</p>

<p>Presently the Fisherman returned with his net,
and stopped up the channel leading to the river.
The Second Fish wished he had followed the
example of the Wise Fish; but he soon thought
of a plan to escape. He floated upside down on
the surface of the water, and the fisherman, thinking
he was dead, did not trouble about him any

Now, I do not receive anything like so
many benefits, and yet I allow the men to hold

him threw a stone at the dog, and cracked his
head; but at this moment a horse passing by ran
against the man and trod on his foot. A minute
later the horse&#8217;s foot stepped upon a stone, and
his ankle was broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;This will be a lesson

<p class="center"><strong>ADAPTED FROM JOHN GAY</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time, a restless, dissatisfied horse
persuaded all the other horses on the farm that
they were oppressed by the man who owned them,
and that they should rebel against him.</p>

<p>So a meeting was called to which all the horses
came, to argue the matter and see what should
be done. One wanted one thing, one another, and
at the last a young colt, who had not yet been
trained sprang to the front with tossing mane,
and proud, arched neck, and eyes of fire, and
thus addressed the listening throng of horses:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What slaves we are! How low has fallen our
race! Because our fathers lived in their service,
must we too toil? Shall we submit ourselves to
man, and spend our youth in servile tasks; with
straining sinews drag the ploughshare through the
heavy soil, or draw the carrier&#8217;s heavy load in
winter cold or beneath the sun of summer? See
how strong we are, how weak man is! Shall we
subdue our strength, and champ a bit, and serve
his pride? Not so. Away with bit and bridle,
rein and spur! We shall be free as air!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased, and with a step of conscious pride
regained his place among the crowd, from which
came snickers of applause and neighs of praise.</p>

<p>Then from behind the crowd, with slow and
stately movements, came an aged steed. He faced
the turbulent crew, and with firm accents that
compelled their silence, he began to speak:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was young as you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I too
cried out for freedom from the daily toil that
was my task. I soon had better thoughts. Man
toils for us. For us he braves the summer heat, to
store our food. If we lend him our strength to
plough the land, he sows and reaps the grain,
that we may share it, as we share the toil.

<h2><a name="REED" id="REED"></a>THE OAK AND THE REED</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>ADAPTED FROM THE FRENCH OF LA FONTAINE</strong></p>


<p>One day the Oak said to the Reed: &ldquo;Nature
has been indeed unkind to you. She has made
you so weak that even the tiniest bird that flies
bends you to earth beneath her little weight. The
gentlest breeze that scarcely moves the surface of
the lake has power to bend your head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My head, which rises like a mountain, is not
content to stop the blazing rays of sunshine, but
braves even the tempest; the wind that to you
seems to be a hurricane, to me is but a gentle sigh
of wind at eventide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had grown beneath the shelter of my
leafy crown, with which I cover all the ground
around, I would have saved you from the storms
which make you suffer. Alas, you are most often
found along the marshy borders of the kingdom
of the winds. Nature, it seems to me, has been
to you unjust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your pity,&rdquo; said the Reed, &ldquo;comes from good
nature, but have no care for me. The winds for
me hold far less danger than they hold for you.
I bend but do not break. You have till now
resisted all their powerful blows and never bent
your back. But wait the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the gentle little Reed ended these words,
a great north wind rushed down from the horizon
and flung itself on them with fury. The Reed
bent low before it, but the tree defied the anger
of the blast and held its head upright. But the
strong wind drew back, doubled its force, and
with a furious rush tore up the oak tree by its
mighty roots.</p>

<p>The blast passed on and in the quiet that it
left behind, the Reed raised up her head, and
looking sadly at the giant tree whose stately head
lay in the waters of the stream, she sadly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>It is often well to bend before the storms that
threaten us.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="KNOWLEDGE" id="KNOWLEDGE"></a>THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>

<p>Two citizens lived beside each other in a town
in France. The one was rich and had a fine
house, and a garden, horses, and carriages, and
servants to wait on him. But he was stupid, for
when he was a boy at school he learned nothing.
The other man was poor in gold and silver, but
he was rich in knowledge, and full of wisdom,
and he knew all the beauty and the glory of the
world.</p>

<p>These two held constant arguments. The rich
man said that nothing in the world should be
held in honor but riches, and that the wise and
learned should bow to him because of all his
wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he often said, &ldquo;what use is it to
read so many books? They do not bring you
money! You have a small house, you wear the
same coat in the winter that you do in summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wise man could not always answer back,
he had too much to say, and often kept silence.</p>

<p>But a war broke out. All the town, in which
the two men lived, was broken down, and both
men had to leave it to seek their fortune in another
place. The rich man, who had lost his
money, was now poor indeed, for he had nothing,
and wandered through the world getting nothing
but scorn for his ignorance. But the wise man
was welcomed everywhere, and received with
honor because of all the wisdom and the knowledge

<p>With great noise and much tumult a torrent
fell down the mountain side. All fled before it;
horror followed it; it made the country round it

<p>Only one traveler, who was flying from robbers
that were following after him, dared to
cross the stream, and put it as a barrier between
him and the men who were pursuing him. This
gave him confidence although the robbers still
followed. So when he reached the edge of a
broad river, that seemed to him to be an image
of sleep, it looked so soft and peaceable and quiet,
he rode his horse into the water to cross it. It
had no high banks, but a little beach sloped from
the meadow down to meet the water, which looked
so peaceful that it seemed as if a little child might
cross it, to gather flowers on the other side, and
so the traveler thought it held no danger for him.</p>

<p>But the quiet river was very deep, and though
it made no noise, its current ran so strongly that
it lifted both the horse and rider on its waves

<h2>THE TOMTIT AND THE BEAR</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THE BROTHERS GRIMM</strong></p>


<p>One summer day, as a Wolf and a Bear were
walking together in a wood, they heard a bird
singing most sweetly. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the Bear,
&ldquo;what can that bird be that is singing so sweetly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;that is the king of the
birds, we must take care to show him all respect.&rdquo;
(Now I should tell you that this bird was after
all no other than the Tomtit.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; said the Bear, &ldquo;I should
like to see the royal palace; so pray come along
and show me it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, my friend,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;we cannot
see it just yet, we must wait till the queen
comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon afterward the queen came with food in
her beak, and she and the king began to feed their
young ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; said the Bear; and was about to
follow them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a little, Master Bruin,&rdquo; said the Wolf,
&ldquo;we must wait now till the king and queen are
gone again.&rdquo; So they marked the hole where they
had seen the nest, and went away. But the Bear,
being very eager to see the palace, soon came
back again, and, peeping into the nest, saw five
or six young birds lying at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Bruin, &ldquo;this is not a
royal palace: I never saw such a filthy place in
my life; and you are no royal children, you little
base-born brats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the young tomtits heard this they
were very angry, and screamed out: &ldquo;We are not
base-born, you stupid bear! Our father and
mother are honest, good sort of people; and, depend
upon it, you shall suffer for your rudeness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the Wolf and the Bear grew frightened,
and ran away to their dens. But the young tomtits
kept crying and screaming; and when their
father and mother came home and offered them
food, they all said: &ldquo;We will not touch a bit;
no, not though we should die of hunger, till that
rascal Bruin has been punished for calling us
base-born brats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make yourselves easy, my darlings,&rdquo; said the
old king, &ldquo;you may be sure he shall get what
he deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went out to the Bear&#8217;s den, and cried
out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Bruin, the bear! thou
hast been very rude to our lawful children. We
shall therefore make war against thee and thine,
and shall never cease until thou hast been punished
as thou so richly deservest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when the bear heard this, he called together
the ox, the ass, the stag, the fox, and all
the beasts of the earth. And the Tomtit also
called on his side all the birds of the air, both
great and small, and a very large army of wasps,
gnats, bees, and flies, and indeed many other
kinds of insects.</p>

<p>As the time came near when the war was to
begin, the Tomtit sent out spies to see who was
the leader of the enemy&#8217;s forces. So the gnat,
who was by far the best spy of them all, flew
backward and forward in the wood where the
enemy&#8217;s troops were, and at last hid himself under
a leaf on a tree close by.</p>

<p>The Bear, who was standing so near the tree
that the gnat could hear all he said, called to the
fox and said, &ldquo;Reynard, you are the cleverest of
all the beasts; therefore you shall be our leader
and go before us to battle; but we must first agree
upon some signal, by which we may know what
you want us to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the fox, &ldquo;I have a fine long,
bushy tail, which is very like a plume of red
feathers, and gives me a very warlike air. Now
remember, when you see me raise up my tail, you
may be sure that the battle is won, and you have
then nothing to do but to rush down upon the
enemy with all your force. On the other hand,
if I drop my tail, the battle is lost, and you must
run away as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when the gnat had heard all this, she flew
back to the Tomtit and told him everything that
had passed.</p>

<p>At length the day came when the battle was
to be fought. As soon as it was light, the army
of beasts came rushing forward with such a fearful
sound that the earth shook. King Tomtit,
with his troops, came flying along also in warlike
array, flapping and fluttering, and beating the air,
so that it was quite frightful to hear; and both
armies set themselves in order of battle upon the
field.</p>

<p>Now the Tomtit gave orders to a troop of
wasps that at the first onset they should march
straight toward Captain Reynard and fixing themselves
about his tail, should sting him with all
their might. The wasps did as they were told;
and when Reynard felt the first sting, he started
aside and shook one of his legs, but still held up
his tail with wonderful bravery. At the second
sting he was forced to drop his tail for a moment;
but when the third wasp had fixed itself,
he could bear it no longer, and clapped his tail
between his legs, and ran away as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>As soon as the beasts saw this, they thought of
course all was lost, and raced across the country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
away to their holes.</p>

<p>Then the king and queen of the birds flew back
in joy to their children, and said: &ldquo;Now, children,
eat, drink, and be merry, for we have won the
battle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the young birds said: &ldquo;No; not till Bruin
has humbly begged our pardon for calling us
base-born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the king flew back to the bear&#8217;s den, and
cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou villain bear! come forthwith to my nest,
and humbly ask my children to forgive the insult
thou hast offered them. If thou wilt not do this,
every bone in thy body shall be broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the bear was forced to crawl out of his
den very sulkily, and do what the king bade
him; and after that the young birds sat down
together, and ate, and drank, and made merry
till midnight.</p>

<h2><a name="STRIPES" id="STRIPES"></a>WHY JIMMY SKUNK WEARS STRIPES<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY THORNTON W. BURGESS</strong></p>


<p>Jimmy Skunk, as everybody knows, wears a
striped suit, a suit of black and white. There
was a time, long, long ago, when all the Skunk
family wore black. Very handsome their coats
were, too, a beautiful glossy black. They were
very, very proud of them, and took the greatest
care of them, brushing them carefully ever so
many times a day.</p>

<p>There was a Jimmy Skunk then, just as there
is now, and he was head of all the Skunk family.
Now, this Jimmy Skunk was very proud, and
thought himself very much of a gentleman. He
was very independent, and cared for no one.
Like a great many other independent people, he
did not always consider the rights of others. Indeed,
it was hinted in the wood and on the Green
Meadows that not all of Jimmy Skunk&#8217;s doings
would bear the light of day. It was openly said
that he was altogether too fond of prowling about
at night, but no one could prove that he was
responsible for mischief done in the night, for no
one saw him. You see his coat was so black
that in the darkness of the night it was not visible
at all.</p>

<p>Now, about this time of which I am telling
you, Mrs. Ruffed Grouse made a nest at the foot
of the Great Pine, and in it she laid fifteen beautiful
buff eggs. Mrs. Grouse was very happy, very
happy indeed, and all the little meadow folks who
knew of her happiness were happy, too, for they
all loved shy, demure, little Mrs. Grouse. Every
morning when Peter Rabbit trotted down the
Lone Little Path through the wood past the Great
Pine he would stop for a few minutes to chat
with Mrs. Grouse. Happy Jack Squirrel would
bring her the news every afternoon. The Merry
Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind would
run up a dozen times a day to see how she was
getting along.</p>

<p>One morning Peter Rabbit, coming down the
Lone Little Path for his usual morning call, found
a terrible state of affairs. Poor little Mrs. Grouse
was heartbroken. All about the foot of the Great
Pine lay the empty shells of their beautiful eggs.
They had been broken and scattered this way and
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; sobbed poor little Mrs. Grouse.
&ldquo;In the night when I was fast asleep something
pounced upon me. I managed to get away and
fly up in the top of the Great Pine. In the morning
I found all my eggs broken, just as you see
them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit looked the ground over very carefully.
He hunted around behind the Great Pine,
he looked under the bushes, he studied the ground
with a very wise air. Then he hopped off down
the Lone Little Path to the Green Meadows. He
stopped at the house of Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes your eyes so big and round?&rdquo;
asked Johnny Chuck. Peter Rabbit came very
close so as to whisper in Johnny Chuck&#8217;s ear, and
told him all that he had seen. Together they went
to Jimmy Skunk&#8217;s house. Jimmy Skunk was in
bed. He was very sleepy and very cross when he
came to the door. Peter Rabbit told him what
he had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad! Too bad!&rdquo; said Jimmy Skunk, and
yawned sleepily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you join us in trying to find out who
did it?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk said he would be delighted to
come, but that he had some other business that
morning and he would join them in the afternoon.
Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck went on. Pretty
soon they met the Merry Little Breezes and told
them the dreadful story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ll hurry over, and tell Old Dame Nature,&rdquo;
cried the Merry Little Breezes, &ldquo;and ask her
what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So away flew the Merry Little Breezes to Old
Dame Nature and told her all the dreadful story.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Old Dame Nature listened very attentively. Then
she sent the Merry Little Breezes to all the little
meadow folks to tell everyone to be at the Great
Pine that afternoon. Now, whatever Old Dame
Nature commanded, all the little meadow folks
were obliged to do. They did not dare to disobey
her.</p>

<p>Promptly at 4 o&#8217;clock that afternoon all the
little meadow folks were gathered around the
foot of the Great Pine. Brokenhearted little Mrs.
Ruffed Grouse sat beside her empty nest, with
all the broken shells about her.</p>

<p>Reddy Fox, Peter Rabbit, Johnny Chuck, Billy
Mink, Little Joe Otter, Jerry Muskrat, Hooty the
Owl, Bobby Coon, Sammy Jay, Blacky the Crow,
Grandfather Frog, Mr. Toad, Spotty the Turtle,
the Merry Little Breezes, all were there. Last of
all came Jimmy Skunk. Very handsome he looked
in his shining black coat, and very sorry he appeared
that such a dreadful thing should have
happened. He told Mrs. Grouse how badly he
felt, and he loudly demanded that the culprit
should be run down without delay and severely
punished.</p>

<p>Old Dame Nature has the most smiling face
in the world, but this time it was very, very
grave indeed. First she asked little Mrs. Grouse
to tell her story all over again that all might hear.
Then each in turn was asked to tell where he
had been the night before. Johnny Chuck, Happy
Jack Squirrel, Striped Chipmunk, Sammy Jay,
and Blacky the Crow had gone to bed when Mr.
Sun went down behind the Purple Hills. Jerry
Muskrat, Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Grandfather
Frog, and Spotty the Turtle had been
down in Farmer Brown&#8217;s corn-field. Hooty the
Owl had been hunting in the lower end of the
Green Meadows. Peter Rabbit had been down in
the Berry Patch. Mr. Toad had been under the
big piece of bark which he called a house. Old
Dame Nature called on Jimmy Skunk last of all.
Jimmy protested that he had been very, very tired
and had gone to bed very early indeed, and had
slept the whole night through.</p>

<p>Then Old Dame Nature asked Peter Rabbit
what he had found among the shells that morning.</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit hopped out and laid three long
black hairs before Old Dame Nature. &ldquo;These,&rdquo;
said Peter Rabbit, &ldquo;are what I found among the
egg shells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Old Dame Nature called Johnny Chuck.
&ldquo;Tell us, Johnny Chuck,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what you
saw when you called at Jimmy Skunk&#8217;s house this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Jimmy Skunk,&rdquo; said Johnny Chuck, &ldquo;and
Jimmy seemed very, very sleepy. It seemed to
me that his whiskers were yellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Old Dame Nature, and she
called Old Mother West Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did you come down on the Green
Meadows this morning?&rdquo; asked Old Dame Nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just at the break of day,&rdquo; said Old Mother
West Wind, &ldquo;as Mr. Sun was coming up from
behind the Purple Hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whom did you see so early in the morning?&rdquo;
asked old Dame Nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw Bobby Coon going home from old Farmer
Brown&#8217;s corn-field,&rdquo; said Old Mother West Wind.
&ldquo;I saw Hooty the Owl coming back from the
lower end of the Green Meadows. I saw Peter
Rabbit down in the berry patch. Last of all, I
saw something like a black shadow coming down
the Lone Little Path toward the house of Jimmy
Skunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone was looking very hard at Jimmy
Skunk. Jimmy began to look very unhappy and
very uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wears a black coat?&rdquo; asked Dame Nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Skunk!&rdquo; shouted all the little meadow
folks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What might make whiskers yellow?&rdquo; asked
Old Dame Nature.</p>

<p>No one seemed to know at first. Then Peter
Rabbit spoke up. &ldquo;It might be the yolk of an
egg,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are likely to be sleepy on a bright sunny
morning?&rdquo; asked Old Dame Nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People who have been out all night,&rdquo; said
Johnny Chuck, who himself always goes to bed
with the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Skunk,&rdquo; said Old Dame Nature, and
her voice was very stern, very stern indeed, and
her face was very grave. &ldquo;Jimmy Skunk, I
accuse you of having broken and eaten the eggs
of Mrs. Grouse. What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy Skunk hung his head. He hadn&#8217;t a word
to say. He just wanted to sneak away by himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Skunk,&rdquo; said Old Dame Nature,
&ldquo;because your handsome black coat, of which you
are so proud, has made it possible for you to move
about in the night without being seen, and because
we can no longer trust you upon your honor,
henceforth you and your descendants shall wear
a striped coat which is the sign that you cannot
be trusted. Your coat hereafter shall be black
and white, that will always be visible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is why to this day Jimmy Skunk
wears a striped suit of black and white.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>BY JOHN BENNETT</strong></p>


<p>A Boy having a Pet Cat which he Wished to
Feed, Said to Her, &ldquo;Come, Cat, Drink this Dish of
Cream; it will Keep your Fur as Soft as Silk,
and Make you Purr like a Coffee-Mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had no sooner said this than the Cat, with
a Great Glare of her Green Eyes, bristled her
Tail like a Gun-Swab and went over the Back
Fence, head first&mdash;pop!&mdash;as Mad as a Wet Hen.</p>

<p>And this is how she came to do so:</p>

<p>The story is an old one&mdash;very, very old. It
may be Persian; it may be not: that is of very
little moment. It is so old that if all the nine
lives of all the cats that have ever lived in the
world were set up together in a line, the other end
of it would just reach back to the time when this
occurred.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;the cat that ground the coffee in
the king&#8217;s kitchen&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>And this is the story:</p>

<p>Many, many years ago, in a country which was
quite as far from anywhere else as the entire distance
thither and back, there was a huge cat that
ground the coffee in the King&#8217;s kitchen, and
otherwise assisted with the meals.</p>

<p>This cat was, in truth, the actual and very
father of all subsequent cats, and his name was
Sooty Will, for his hair was as black as a night
in a coal-hole. He was ninety years old, and his
mustaches were like whisk-brooms. But the most
singular thing about him was that in all his life
he had never once purred nor humped up his
back, although his master often stroked him. The
fact was that he never had learned to purr, nor
had any reason, so far as he knew, for humping
up his back. And being the father of all the cats,
there was no one to tell him how. It remained
for him to acquire a reason, and from his example
to devise a habit which cats have followed from
that time forth, and no doubt will forever follow.</p>

<p>The King of the country had long been at war
with one of his neighbors, but one morning he
sent back a messenger to say that he had beaten
his foeman at last, and that he was coming home
for an early breakfast as hungry as three bears.
&ldquo;Have batter-cakes and coffee,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;hot,
and plenty of &#8217;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the turnspits capered and yelped with
glee, for batter-cakes and coffee are not cooked
upon spits, and so they were free to sally forth
into the city streets and watch the King&#8217;s homecoming
in a grand parade.</p>

<p>But the cat sat down on his tail in the corner
and looked cross. &ldquo;Scat!&rdquo; said he, with an angry
caterwaul. &ldquo;It is not fair that you should go and
that I should not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it is,&rdquo; said the gleeful turnspits;
&ldquo;turn and turn about is fair play: you saw the
rat that was killed in the parlor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn about fair play, indeed!&rdquo; cried the cat.
&ldquo;Then all of you get to your spits; I am sure that
is turn about!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the turnspits, wagging their tails
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and laughing. &ldquo;That is over and over again,
which is not fair play. &#8217;Tis the coffee-mill that
is turn and turn about. So turn about to your
mill, Sooty Will; we are off to see the King!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img229b.jpg" width="500" height="284" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;turning hand-springs, head-springs,
and heel-springs as they went&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>With that they pranced out into
the court-yard, turning hand-springs,
head-springs, and heel-springs as
they went, and, after giving three
hearty and vociferous cheers in a
grand chorus at the bottom of the
garden, went capering away for
their holiday.</p>

<p>The cat spat at their vanishing
heels, sat down on his tail in the
chimney-corner, and was very glum
indeed.</p>

<p>Just then the cook looked in from
the pantry. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said gruffly.
&ldquo;Come, hurry up the coffee!&rdquo; That
was the way he always gave his orders.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img229a.jpg" width="300" height="177" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;hullo!&rsquo; he said gruffly.<br />
&lsquo;come, hurry up the coffee!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The black cat&#8217;s whiskers bristled. He turned
to the mill with a fierce frown, his long tail going
to and fro like that of a tiger in its lair; for
Sooty Will had a temper like hot gunpowder, that
was apt to go off <em>sizz</em>, <em>whizz</em>, <em>bang</em>! and no one
to save the pieces. Yet, at least while the cook
was by, he turned the mill furiously, as if with a
right good-will.</p>

<p>Meantime, out in the city a glorious day came
on. The sun went buzzing up the pink-and-yellow
sky with a sound like that of a walking-doll&#8217;s
works, or of a big Dutch clock behind a
door; banners waved from the castled heights,
and bugles sang from every tower; the city gates
rang with the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd.
Up from cellars, down from lofts, off work-benches,
and out at the doors of their masters&#8217;
shops, dodging the thwacks of their masters&#8217;
straps, &ldquo;pop-popping&rdquo; like corks from the necks
of so many bottles, came apprentices, shop-boys,
knaves and scullions, crying: &ldquo;God save the
King! Hurrah! Hurrah! Masters and work
may go to Rome; our tasks shall wait on our own
sweet wills; &#8217;t is holiday when the King comes
home. God save the King! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the procession. There were first
three regiments of trumpeters, all blowing different
tunes; then fifteen regiments of mounted infantry
on coal-black horses, forty squadrons of
green-and-blue dragoons, and a thousand drummers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and fifers in scarlet and blue and gold, making
a thundering din with their rootle-te-tootle-te-tootle-te-rootle;
and pretty well up to the front
in the ranks was the King himself, bowing and
smiling to the populace, with his hand on his
breast; and after him the army, all in shining
armor, just enough pounded to be picturesque,
miles on miles of splendid men, all bearing the
trophies of glorious war, and armed with lances
and bows and arrows, falchions, morgensterns,
martels-de-fer, and other choice implements of
justifiable homicide, and the reverse, such as
hautboys and sackbuts and accordions and dudelsacks
and Scotch bagpipes&mdash;a glorious sight!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img230.jpg" width="500" height="423" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a part of the grand procession</span>
</div>

<p>And, as has been said before, the city gates rang
with the cheers of the crowd, crimson banners
waved over the city&#8217;s pinnacled summits, and
bugles blew, trumpets brayed, and drums beat
until it seemed that wild uproar and rich display
had reached its high millennium.</p>

<p>The black cat turned the coffee-mill. &ldquo;My oh!
my oh!&rdquo; he said. "It certainly is not fair that
those bench-legged turnspits with feet like so
much leather should see the King marching home
in his glory, while I, who go shod, as it were, in
velvet, should hear only the sound through the
scullery windows. It is not fair. It is no doubt
true that &ldquo;The cat may mew, and the dog shall
have his day,&rdquo; but I have as much right to my day
as he; and has it not been said from immemorial
time that &lsquo;A cat may look at a king&rsquo;? Indeed it
has, quite as much as that the dog may have his
day. I will not stand it; it is not fair. A cat may
look at a king; and if any cat may look at a king,
why, I am the cat who may. There are no other
cats in the world; I am the only one. Poh! the
cook may shout till his breath gives out, he cannot
frighten me; for once I am going to have my
fling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he forthwith swallowed the coffee-mill, box,
handle, drawer-knobs, coffee-well, and all, and
was off to see the King.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But, ah! the sad and undeniable
truth, that brightest joys too soon must end!
Triumphs cannot last forever, even in a land of
legends. There comes a reckoning.</p>

<p>When the procession was past and gone, as all
processions pass and go, vanishing down the
shores of forgetfulness; when barons, marquises,
dukes, and dons were gone, with their pennants
and banners; when the last lancers had gone
prancing past and were lost to sight down the
circuitous avenue, Sooty Will, with drooping tail,
stood by the palace gate, dejected. He was sour
and silent and glum. Indeed, who would not be,
with a coffee-mill on his conscience? To own up
to the entire truth, the cat was feeling decidedly
unwell; when suddenly the cook popped his head
in at the scullery entry, crying, &ldquo;How now, how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
now, you vagabonds! The war is done, but the
breakfast is not. Hurry up, scurry up, scamper
and trot! The cakes are all cooked and are piping
hot! Then why is the coffee so slow?&rdquo;
The King was in the dining-hall, in dressing-gown
and slippers, irately calling for his breakfast!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 199px;">
<img src="images/img231b.jpg" width="199" height="151" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;he forthwith swallowed the coffee-mill&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The shamefaced, guilty cat ran hastily down
the scullery stairs and hid under the refrigerator,
with such a deep inward sensation of remorse
that he dared not look the kind cook in the face.
It now really seemed to him as if everything had
gone wrong with the world, especially his own
insides. This any one will readily believe who
has ever swallowed a coffee-mill. He began to
weep copiously.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/img231d.jpg" width="153" height="132" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;and was off to see the king&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The cook came into the kitchen. &ldquo;Where is the
coffee?&rdquo; he said; then, catching sight of the secluded
cat, he stooped, crying, &ldquo;Where is the
coffee?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 170px;">
<img src="images/img231a.jpg" width="170" height="124" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;the cat was feeling decidedly unwell&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The cat sobbed audibly. &ldquo;Some one must have
come into the kitchen while I ran out to look at
the King!&rdquo; he gasped, for there seemed to him no
way out of the scrape but by telling a plausible
untruth. &ldquo;Some one must have come into the
kitchen and stolen it!&rdquo; And with that, choking
upon the handle of the mill, which projected into
his throat, he burst into inarticulate sobs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/img231c.jpg" width="125" height="105" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;it seemed as if everything had gone wrong&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The cook, who was, in truth, a very kind-hearted
man, sought to reassure the poor cat.
&ldquo;There; it is unfortunate, very; but do not weep;
thieves thrive in kings&#8217; houses!&rdquo; he said, and,
stooping, he began to stroke the drooping cat&#8217;s
back to show that he held the weeping creature
blameless.</p>

<p>Sooty Will&#8217;s heart leaped into his throat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/img231e.jpg" width="212" height="185" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;where is the coffee?&rsquo; said the cook&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; he half gasped, &ldquo;oh, oh! If he rubs
his great hand down my back he will feel the
corners of the coffee-mill through my ribs as sure
as fate! Oh, oh! I am a gone cat!&rdquo; And with
that, in an agony of apprehension lest his guilt
and his falsehood be thus presently detected, he
humped up his back as high in the air as he could,
so that the corners of the mill might not make
bumps in his sides and that the mill might thus
remain undiscovered.</p>

<p>But, alas! he forgot that coffee-mills turn. As
he humped up his back to cover his guilt, the coffee-mill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
inside rolled over, and, as it rolled, began
to grind&mdash;<em>rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr-rr!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! you have swallowed the mill!&rdquo; cried
the cook.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/img232a.jpg" width="430" height="269" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;out stepped the genius that lived under the great ovens&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the cat; &ldquo;I was only thinking
aloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that out stepped the Genius that Lived under
the Great Ovens, and, with his finger pointed at
the cat, said in a frightful voice, husky with
wood-ashes: &ldquo;Miserable and pusillanimous beast!
By telling a falsehood to cover a wrong you have
only made bad matters worse. For betraying
man&#8217;s kindness to cover your shame, a curse shall
be upon you and all your kind until the end of the
world. Whenever men stroke you in kindness,
remembrance of your guilt shall make you hump
up your back with shame, as you did to avoid being
found out; and in order that the reason for
this curse shall never be forgotten, whenever man
is kind to a cat the sound of the grinding of a
coffee-mill inside shall perpetually remind him of
your guilt and shame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the Genius vanished in a cloud of
smoke.</p>

<p>And it was even as he said. From that day
Sooty Will could never abide having his back
stroked without humping it up to conceal the mill
within him; and never did he hump up his back
but the coffee-mill began slowly to grind, <em>rr-rr-rr-rr!</em>
inside him; so that, even in the prime of
life, before his declining days had come, being
seized upon by a great remorse for these things
which might never be amended, he retired to a
home for aged and reputable cats, and there, so
far as the records reveal, lived the remainder of
his days in charity and repentance.</p>

<p>But the curse has come down even to the present
day, as the Genius that Lived under the Great
Ovens said, and still maintains, though cats have
probably forgotten the facts, and so, when stroked,
hump up their backs and purr as if these actions
were a matter of pride instead of being a blot
upon their family record.</p>

<h2>THE GREEDY CAT</h2>


<p>Once on a time there was a man who had a Cat,
and she was so awfully big, and such a beast to
eat, he couldn&#8217;t keep her any longer. So she
was to go down to the river with a stone round
her neck, but before she started she was to have
a meal of meat. So the goody set before her a
bowl of porridge and a little trough of fat. That
the creature crammed into her, and ran off and
jumped through the window. Outside stood the
goodman by the barn-door threshing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, goodman,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, pussy,&rdquo; said the goodman; &ldquo;have
you had any food to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge and
a trough of fat&mdash;and, now I think of it, I&#8217;ll take
you, too,&rdquo; and so she took the goodman and
gobbled him up.</p>

<p>When she had done that, she went into the
byre, and there sat the goody milking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, goody,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, pussy,&rdquo; said the goody; &ldquo;are you
here, and have you eaten up your food yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve eaten a little to-day, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most
fasting,&rdquo; said pussy; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman&mdash;and,
now I think of it, I&#8217;ll take you, too,&rdquo; and
so she took the goody and gobbled her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you cow at the manger,&rdquo; said the
Cat to Daisy the cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, pussy,&rdquo; said the bell-cow; &ldquo;have
you had any food to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;I&#8217;ve only had a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody&mdash;and, now I think of it, I&#8217;ll take you,
too,&rdquo; and so she took the cow and gobbled her up.</p>

<p>Then off she set into the home-field, and there
stood a man picking up leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you leaf-picker in the field,&rdquo; said
the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, pussy; have you had anything to
eat to-day?&rdquo; said the leaf-picker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and Daisy the cow&mdash;and, now I think of
it, I&#8217;ll take you, too.&rdquo; So she took the leaf-picker
and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>Then she came to a heap of stones, and there
stood a stoat and peeped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mr. Stoat of Stoneheap,&rdquo; said the
Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge, and
a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the goody,
and the cow, and the leaf-picker&mdash;and, now I
think of it, I&#8217;ll take you, too.&rdquo; So she took the
stoat and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>When she had gone a bit farther, she came to
a hazel-brake, and there sat a squirrel gathering
nuts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Sir Squirrel of the Brake,&rdquo; said
the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat&mdash;and, now I think of it, I&#8217;ll take you,
too.&rdquo; So she took the squirrel and gobbled him
up.</p>

<p>When she had gone a little farther, she saw
Reynard the fox, who was prowling about by
the woodside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Reynard Slyboots,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat, and the squirrel&mdash;and, now I think of it,
I&#8217;ll take you, too.&rdquo; So she took Reynard and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
gobbled him up.</p>

<p>When she had gone a little farther she met
Long Ears, the hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mr. Hopper the hare,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat, and the squirrel, and the fox&mdash;and, now I
think of it, I&#8217;ll take you, too.&rdquo; So she took the
hare and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>When she had gone a bit farther she met
a wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you Greedy Graylegs,&rdquo; said the
Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge, and
a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the goody,
and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the stoat,
and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare&mdash;and
now I think of it, I may as well take you, too.&rdquo;
So she took and gobbled up Graylegs, too.</p>

<p>So she went on into the wood, and when she
had gone far and farther than far, o&#8217;er hill and
dale, she met a bear-cub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you bare-breeched bear,&rdquo; said the
Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy,&rdquo; said the bear-cub;
&ldquo;have you had anything to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge, and
a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the goody,
and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the stoat,
and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare, and
the wolf&mdash;and, now I think of it, I may as well
take you, too.&rdquo; And so she took the bear-cub
and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>When the Cat had gone a bit farther, she met
a she-bear, who was tearing away at a stump
till the splinters flew, so angry was she at having
lost her cub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you Mrs. Bruin,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat, and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare,
and the wolf, and the bear-cub&mdash;and, now I think
of it, I&#8217;ll take you, too,&rdquo; and so she took Mrs.
Bruin and gobbled her up, too.</p>

<p>When the Cat got still farther on, she met
Baron Bruin himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you Baron Bruin,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy,&rdquo; said Bruin; &ldquo;have
you had anything to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge, and
a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the goody,
and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the stoat,
and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare, and
the wolf, and the bear-cub, and the she-bear&mdash;and,
now I think of it, I&#8217;ll take you, too,&rdquo; and
so she took Bruin and ate him up, too.</p>

<p>So the Cat went on and on, and farther than
far, till she came to the abodes of men again, and
there she met a bridal train on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you bridal train on the king&#8217;s highway,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and
the stoat, and the squirrel, and the fox, and the
hare, and the wolf, and the bear-cub, and the
she-bear, and the he-bear&mdash;and, now I think of
it, I&#8217;ll take you, too,&rdquo; and so she rushed at them,
and gobbled up both the bride and bridegroom,
and the whole train, with the cook and the fiddler,
and the horses and all.</p>

<p>When she had gone still farther, she came to a
church, and there she met a funeral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you funeral train,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge, and
a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat, and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare,
and the wolf, and the bear-cub, and the she-bear,
and the he-bear, and the bride and bridegroom,
and the whole train&mdash;and, now, I don&#8217;t mind if I
take you, too,&rdquo; and so she fell on the funeral
train and gobbled up both the body and the bearers.</p>

<p>Now when the Cat had got the body in her, she
was taken up to the sky, and when she had gone
a long, long way, she met the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Moon,&rdquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the
goody, and the cow, and the leaf-picker, and the
stoat, and the squirrel, and the fox, and the hare,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and the wolf, and the bear-cub, and the she-bear,
and the he-bear, and the bride and bridegroom,
and the whole train, and the funeral train&mdash;and,
now I think of it, I don&#8217;t mind if I take you, too,&rdquo;
and so she seized hold of the moon, and gobbled
her up, both new and full.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;that we&#8217;ll fight about,&rsquo; said the billy goat&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the Cat went a long way still, and then she
met the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you sun in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy,&rdquo; said the sun; &ldquo;have
you had anything to eat to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting,&rdquo;
said the Cat; &ldquo;it was only a bowl of porridge,
and a trough of fat, and the goodman, and the

and the whole train, and the funeral train, and
the moon&mdash;and, now I think of it, I don&#8217;t mind
if I take you, too,&rdquo; and so she rushed at the sun
in heaven and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>So the Cat went far and farther than far, till
she came to a bridge, and on it she met a big
billy-goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, you Billy-goat on Broad-bridge,&rdquo;
said the Cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs. Pussy; have you had anything
to eat to-day?&rdquo; said the billy-goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had a little, but I&#8217;m &#8217;most fasting;
I&#8217;ve only had a bowl of porridge, and a trough
of fat, and the goodman, and the goody in the
byre, and Daisy the cow at the manger, and the
leaf-picker in the home-field, and Mr. Stoat of
Stoneheap, and Sir Squirrel of the Brake, and
Reynard Slyboots, and Mr. Hopper the hare, and
Greedy Graylegs the wolf, and Bare-breech the
bear-cub, and Mrs. Bruin, and Baron Bruin, and
a bridal train on the king&#8217;s highway, and a
funeral at the church, and Lady Moon in the sky,
and Lord Sun in heaven&mdash;and, now I think of it,
I&#8217;ll take you, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we&#8217;ll fight about,&rdquo; said the billy-goat,
and butted at the Cat till she fell right
over the bridge into the river, and there she
burst.</p>

<p>So they all crept out one after the other, and
went about their business, and were just as good
as ever, all that the Cat had gobbled up. The
goodman of the house, and the goody in the byre,
and Daisy the cow at the manger, and the leaf-picker
in the home-field, and Mr. Stoat of Stoneheap,
and Sir Squirrel of the Brake, and Reynard

<h2><a name="HILLSIDE" id="HILLSIDE"></a>GUDBRAND ON THE HILLSIDE</h2>


<p>There was once upon a time a man whose name
was Gudbrand. He had a farm which lay far
away up on the side of a hill, and therefore they
called him Gudbrand on the hillside.</p>

<p>He and his wife lived so happily together, and
agreed so well, that whatever the man did the
wife thought it so well done that no one could
do it better. No matter what he did, she thought
it was always the right thing.</p>

<p>They lived on their own farm, and had a hundred
dollars at the bottom of their chest and two
cows in their cow-shed. One day the woman
said to Gudbrand:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to go to town with one of
the cows and sell it, so that we may have some
ready money by us. We are pretty well off, and
ought to have a few shillings in our pocket like
other people. The hundred dollars in the chest
we mustn&#8217;t touch, but I can&#8217;t see what we want
with more than one cow, and it will be much better
for us, as I shall have only one to look after
instead of the two I have now to mind and feed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, Gudbrand thought, that was well and
sensibly spoken. He took the cow at once and
went to town to sell it; but when he got there
no one would buy the cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; thought Gudbrand, &ldquo;I may as well
take the cow home again. I know I have both
stall and food for it, and the way home is no
longer than it was here.&rdquo; So he strolled homeward
again with the cow.</p>

<p>When he had got a bit on the way he met a
man who had a horse to sell, and Gudbrand
thought it was better to have a horse than a cow,
and so he changed the cow for the horse.</p>

<p>When he had gone a bit farther he met a man
who was driving a fat pig before him, and then
he thought it would be better to have a fat pig
than a horse, and so he changed with the man.</p>

<p>He now went a bit farther, and then he met a
man with a goat, and so he thought it was surely
better to have a goat than a pig, and changed
with the man who had the goat.</p>

<p>Then he went a long way, till he met a man
who had a sheep. He changed with him, for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
thought it was always better to have a sheep than
a goat.</p>

<p>When he had got a bit farther he met a man
with a goose, and so he changed the sheep for
the goose. And when he had gone a long, long
way he met a man with a cock. He changed the
goose with him, for he thought this wise: &ldquo;It is
surely better to have a cock than a goose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on till late in the day, when he began
to feel hungry. So he sold the cock for sixpence
and bought some food for himself. &ldquo;For
it is always better to keep body and soul together
than to have a cock,&rdquo; thought Gudbrand.</p>

<p>He then set off again homeward till he came
to his neighbor&#8217;s farm, and there he went in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get on in town?&rdquo; asked the people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, only so-so,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I can&#8217;t boast
of my luck, nor can I grumble at it either.&rdquo; And
then he told them how it had gone with him from
first to last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;ll have a fine reception when you
get home to your wife,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Heaven
help you! I should not like to be in your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I might have fared much worse,&rdquo; said
Gudbrand; &ldquo;but whether I have fared well or ill,
I have such a kind wife that she never says anything,
no matter what I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, so you say; but you won&#8217;t get me to believe
it,&rdquo; said the neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we have a wager on it?&rdquo; said Gudbrand.
&ldquo;I have a hundred dollars in my chest at
home. Will you lay the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they made the wager and Gudbrand remained
there till the evening, when it began to
get dark, and then they went together to the
farm.</p>

<p>The neighbor was to remain outside the
door and listen while Gudbrand went in to his
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; said Gudbrand when he came
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;Heaven be
praised you are back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, here I am!&rdquo; said the man. And then
the wife asked him how he had got on in town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so-so,&rdquo; answered Gudbrand. &ldquo;Not much
to brag of. When I came to town no one would
buy the cow, so I changed it for a horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad of that,&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;We are pretty well off and we ought to drive
to church like other people, and when we can
afford to keep a horse I don&#8217;t see why we should
not have one. Run out, children, and put the
horse in the stable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&#8217;t got the horse, after all,&rdquo; said
Gudbrand; &ldquo;for when I had got a bit on the way
I changed it for a pig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried the woman, &ldquo;that&#8217;s the very
thing I should have done myself. I&#8217;m so glad
of that, for now we can have some bacon in the
house and something to offer people when they
come to see us. What do we want with a horse?
People would only say we had become so grand
that we could no longer walk to church. Run
out, children, and let the pig in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&#8217;t got the pig either,&rdquo; said Gudbrand,
&ldquo;for when I had got a bit farther on the
road I changed it into a milch goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear! dear! how well you manage everything!&rdquo;
cried the wife. &ldquo;When I really come to
think of it, what do I want with the pig? People
would only say: &lsquo;Over yonder they eat up
everything they have.&rsquo; No, now I have a
goat I can have both milk and cheese and keep
the goat into the bargain. Let in the goat,
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&#8217;t got the goat either,&rdquo; said Gudbrand.
&ldquo;When I got a bit on the way I changed
the goat and got a fine sheep for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; returned the woman, &ldquo;you do everything
just as I should wish it&mdash;just as if I had
been there myself. What do we want with a
goat? I should have to climb up hill and down
dale to get it home at night. No, when I have a
sheep I can have wool and clothes in the house
and food as well. Run out, children, and let in
the sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&#8217;t got the sheep any longer,&rdquo; said
Gudbrand, &ldquo;for when I had got a bit on the way
I changed it for a goose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you for that!&rdquo; said the woman;
&ldquo;and many thanks, too! What do I want with
a sheep? I have neither wheel nor spindle, and
I do not care either to toil and drudge making
clothes; we can buy clothes now as before. Now
I can have goose-fat, which I have so long been
wishing for, and some feathers to stuff that little
pillow of mine. Run, children, and let in the
goose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&#8217;t got the goose either,&rdquo; said
Gudbrand. &ldquo;When I had got a bit farther on the
way I changed it for a cock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&#8217;t know how you can think of it
all!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;It&#8217;s just as if I had
done it all myself. A cock! Why, it&#8217;s just the
same as if you&#8217;d bought an eight-day clock, for
every morning the cock will crow at four, so we
can be up in good time. What do we want with
a goose? I can&#8217;t make goose-fat and I can easily
fill my pillow with some soft grass. Run, children,
and let in the cock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&#8217;t the cock either,&rdquo; said Gudbrand;
&ldquo;for when I had got a bit farther I became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
so terribly hungry I had to sell the cock
for sixpence and get some food to keep body and
soul together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised you did that!&rdquo; cried the
woman. &ldquo;Whatever you do, you always do the
very thing I could have wished. Besides, what
did we want with the cock? We are our own
masters and can lie as long as we like in the
mornings. Heaven be praised! As long as I
have got you back again, who manage everything
so well, I shall neither want cock, nor goose,
nor pig, nor cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gudbrand then opened the door. &ldquo;Have I won
the hundred dollars now?&rdquo; he asked. And the
neighbor was obliged to confess that he had.</p>

<h2><a name="HONEY" id="HONEY"></a>PORK AND HONEY</h2>


<p>At dawn the other day, when Bruin came tramping
over the bog with a fat pig, Reynard sat up
on a stone by the moorside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, grandsire,&rdquo; said the fox. &ldquo;What&#8217;s
that so nice that you have there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pork,&rdquo; said Bruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have got a dainty bit, too,&rdquo; said Reynard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest wild bee&#8217;s comb I ever saw in
my life,&rdquo; said Reynard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you don&#8217;t say so,&rdquo; said Bruin, who
grinned and licked his lips, he thought it would
be so nice to taste a little honey. At last he said:
&ldquo;Shall we swap our fare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; said Reynard, &ldquo;I can&#8217;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end was that they made a bet, and agreed
to name three trees. If the fox could say them
off faster than the bear, he was to have leave to
take one bite of the bacon; but if the bear could
say them faster, he was to have leave to take
one sup out of the comb. Greedy Bruin thought
he was sure to sup out all the honey at one
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Reynard, &ldquo;it&#8217;s all fair and right,
no doubt, but all I say is, if I win, you shall be
bound to tear off the bristles where I am to bite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bruin, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll help you, as you
can&#8217;t help yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they were to begin and name the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fir, Scotch Fir, Spruce</span>,&rdquo; growled out
Bruin, for he was gruff in his tongue, that he
was. But for all that he only named two trees,
for fir and Scotch fir are both the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ash</em>, <em>Aspen</em>, <em>Oak</em>,&rdquo; screamed Reynard, so that
the wood rang again.</p>

<p>So he had won the wager, and down he ran
and took the heart out of the pig at one bit, and
was just running off with it. But Bruin was
angry because Reynard had taken the best bit
out of the whole pig, and so he laid hold of his
tail and held him fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit, stop a bit,&rdquo; he said, and was wild
with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the fox, &ldquo;it&#8217;s all right; let
me go, grandsire, and I&#8217;ll give you a taste of
my honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Bruin heard that, he let go his hold, and
away went Reynard after the honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, on this honeycomb,&rdquo; said Reynard,
&ldquo;lies a leaf, and under this leaf is a hole, and
that hole you are to suck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this he held up the comb under the
bear&#8217;s nose, took off the leaf, jumped up on a
stone, and began to gibber and laugh, for there
was neither honey nor honeycomb, but a wasp&#8217;s
nest, as big as a man&#8217;s head, full of wasps, and
out swarmed the wasps and settled on Bruin&#8217;s
head, and stung him in his eyes and ears, and
mouth and snout. And he had such hard work
to rid himself of them that he had no time to
think of Reynard.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s why, ever since that day, Bruin
is so afraid of wasps.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BRUIN" id="BRUIN"></a>HOW REYNARD OUTWITTED BRUIN</h2>


<p>Once on a time there was a bear, who sat on a
hillside in the sun and slept. Just then Reynard
came slouching by and caught sight of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you sit taking your ease, grandsire,&rdquo;
said the fox. &ldquo;Now, see if I don&#8217;t play you a
trick.&rdquo; So he went and caught three field-mice
and laid them on a stump close under Bruin&#8217;s
nose, and then he bawled out into his ear, &ldquo;Bo!
Bruin, here&#8217;s Peter the Hunter, just behind
this stump&rdquo;; and as he bawled this out he
ran off through the wood as fast as ever he
could.</p>

<p>Bruin woke up with a start, and when he saw
the three little mice, he was as mad as a March
hare, and was going to lift up his paw and crush
them, for he thought it was they who had bellowed
in his ear.</p>

<p>But just as he lifted it he caught sight of Reynard&#8217;s
tail among the bushes by the woodside,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and away he set after him, so that the underwood
crackled as he went, and, to tell the truth, Bruin
was so close upon Reynard that he caught hold
of his off hind foot just as he was crawling into
an earth under a pine-root. So there was Reynard
in a pinch; but for all that he had his wits
about him, for he screeched out, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Slip the pine-root
and catch Reynard&#8217;s foot</span>,&rdquo; and so the
silly bear let his foot slip and laid hold of the
root instead. But by that time Reynard was safe
inside the earth, and called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cheated you that time, too, didn&#8217;t I, grandsire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of sight isn&#8217;t out of mind,&rdquo; growled
Bruin down the earth, and was wild with rage.</p>

<h2><a name="CRESTED" id="CRESTED"></a>THE COCK AND THE CRESTED HEN</h2>


<p>There was once a Cock who had a whole farmyard
of hens to look after and manage; and
among them was a tiny little Crested Hen. She
thought she was altogether too grand to be in
company with the other hens, for they looked so
old and shabby; she wanted to go out and strut
about all by herself, so that people could see how
fine she was, and admire her pretty crest and
beautiful plumage.</p>

<p>So one day when all the hens were strutting
about on the dust-heap and showing themselves
off, and picking and clucking, as they were wont
to do, this desire seized her, and she began to
cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, over the fence!
cluck, cluck, cluck, over the fence!&rdquo; and wanted
to get away.</p>

<p>The Cock stretched his neck and shook his
comb and feathers, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go not there!&rdquo; And all the old hens cackled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go-go-go-go not there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she set off for all that; and was not a little
proud when she got away, and could go about
pluming and showing herself off quite alone.</p>

<p>Just then a hawk began to fly round in a circle
above her, and all of a sudden he swooped down
upon her. The Cock, as he stood on top of
the dust-heap, stretching his neck and peering
first with one eye and then with the other,
had long noticed him, and cried with all his
might:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, come and help! Come, come,
come and help!&rdquo; till the people came running to
see what was the matter. They frightened the
hawk so that he let go the Hen, and had to be
satisfied with her tuft and her finest feathers,
which he had plucked from her. And then, you
may be sure, she lost no time in running-home;
she stretched her neck, and tripped along, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, see, see, see how I look! See, see, see,
see how I look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Cock came up to her in his dignified way,
drooped one of his wings, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&#8217;t I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that time the Hen did not consider herself
too good to be in the company of the old
hens on the dust-heap.</p>

<h2><a name="TRAMP" id="TRAMP"></a>THE OLD WOMAN AND THE TRAMP</h2>


<p>There was once a tramp who went plodding his
way through a forest. The distance between the
houses was so great that he had little hope of
finding a shelter before the night set in. But all
of a sudden he saw some lights between the trees.
He then discovered a cottage, where there was a
fire burning on the hearth. How nice it would
be to roast one&#8217;s self before that fire, and to get
a bite of something, he thought; and so he
dragged himself toward the cottage.</p>

<p>Just then an old woman came toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, and well met!&rdquo; said the tramp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Where do
you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;South of the sun, and east of the moon,&rdquo; said
the tramp; &ldquo;and now I am on the way home
again, for I have been all over the world with
the exception of this parish,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be a great traveler, then,&rdquo; said the
woman. &ldquo;What may be your business here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want a shelter for the night,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;but
you may as well get away from here at once, for
my husband is not at home, and my place is not
an inn,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good woman,&rdquo; said the tramp, &ldquo;you must
not be so cross and hard-hearted, for we are both
human beings, and should help one another, as
it is written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help one another?&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;help?
Did you ever hear such a thing? Who&#8217;ll help
me, do you think? I haven&#8217;t got a morsel in the
house! No, you&#8217;ll have to look for quarters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
elsewhere,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But the tramp was like the rest of his kind; he
did not consider himself beaten at the first rebuff.
Although the old woman grumbled and complained
as much as she could, he was just as persistent
as ever, and went on begging and praying
like a starved dog, until at last she gave in,
and he got permission to lie on the floor for the
night.</p>

<p>That was very kind, he thought, and he
thanked her for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better on the floor without sleep, than suffer
cold in the forest deep,&rdquo; he said; for he was a
merry fellow, this tramp, and was always ready
with a rhyme.</p>

<p>When he came into the room he could see that
the woman was not so badly off as she had pretended;
but she was a greedy and stingy woman
of the worst sort, and was always complaining
and grumbling.</p>

<p>He now made himself very agreeable, of
course, and asked her in his most insinuating
manner for something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I to get it from?&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t tasted a morsel myself the whole
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the tramp was a cunning fellow, he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old granny, you must be starving,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Well, well, I suppose I shall have to ask
you to have something with me, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have something with you!&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;You don&#8217;t look as if you could ask any one to
have anything! What have you got to offer
one, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who far and wide does roam sees many
things not known at home; and he who many
things has seen has wits about him and senses
keen,&rdquo; said the tramp. &ldquo;Better dead than lose
one&#8217;s head! Lend me a pot, granny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman now became very inquisitive,
as you may guess, and so she let him have a pot.</p>

<p>He filled it with water and put it on the fire,
and then he blew with all his might till the fire
was burning fiercely all round it. Then he took
a four-inch nail from his pocket, turned it three
times in his hand, and put it into the pot.</p>

<p>The woman stared with all her might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s this going to be?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nail broth,&rdquo; said the tramp, and began to stir
the water with the porridge-stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nail broth?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, nail broth,&rdquo; said the tramp.</p>

<p>The old woman had seen and heard a good deal
in her time, but that anybody could have made
broth with a nail, well, she had never heard the
like before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s something for poor people to know,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I should like to learn how to make
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which is not worth having will always
go a-begging,&rdquo; said the tramp, but if she wanted
to learn how to make it she had only to watch
him, he said, and went on stirring the broth.</p>

<p>The old woman squatted on the ground, her
hands clasping her knees, and her eyes following
his hand as he stirred the broth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This generally makes good broth,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but this time it will very likely be rather thin,
for I have been making broth the whole week
with the same nail. If one only had a handful
of sifted oatmeal to put in, that would make
it all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what one has to go
without, it&#8217;s no use thinking more about,&rdquo; and
so he stirred the broth again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I have a scrap of flour somewhere,&rdquo;
said the old woman, and went out to
fetch some, and it was both good and fine.</p>

<p>The tramp began putting the flour into the
broth, and went on stirring, while the woman
sat staring now at him and then at the pot until
her eyes nearly burst their sockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This broth would be good enough for company,&rdquo;
he said, putting in one handful of flour
after another. &ldquo;If I had only a bit of salted beef
and few potatoes to put in, it would be fit for
gentlefolks, however particular they might be,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But what one has to go without, it&#8217;s
no use thinking more about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the old woman really began to think it
over, she thought she had some potatoes, and
perhaps a bit of beef as well; and these she gave
the tramp, who went on stirring, while she sat
and stared as hard as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be grand enough for the best in the
land,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;and just
fancy&mdash;all with a nail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was really a wonderful man, that tramp!
He could do more than drink a sup and turn the
tankard up, he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If one had only a little barley and a drop of
milk, we could ask the king himself to have some
of it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for this is what he has every
blessed evening&mdash;that I know, for I have been
in service under the king&#8217;s cook,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Ask the king to have some! Well,
I never!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman, slapping her
knees. She was quite awestruck at the tramp
and his grand connections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what one has to go without, it&#8217;s no use
thinking more about,&rdquo; said the tramp.</p>

<p>And then she remembered she had a little barley;
and as for milk, well, she wasn&#8217;t quite out
of that, she said. And then she went to fetch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
both the one and the other.</p>

<p>The tramp went on stirring, and the woman
sat staring, one moment at him and the next at
the pot.</p>

<p>Then all at once the tramp took out the
nail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it&#8217;s ready, and now we&#8217;ll have a real
good feast,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But to this kind of soup
the king and the queen always take a dram or
two, and one sandwich at least. And then they
always have a cloth on the table when they eat,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But what one has to go without, it&#8217;s
no use thinking more about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by this time the old woman herself had
begun to feel quite grand and fine, I can tell you;
and if that was all that was wanted to make it
just as the king had it, she thought it would be
nice to have it exactly the same way for once,
and play at being king and queen with the tramp.
She went straight to a cupboard and brought out
the brandy bottle, dram glasses, butter and
cheese, smoked beef and veal, until at last the
table looked as if it were decked out for company.</p>

<p>Never in her life had the old woman had such
a grand feast, and never had she tasted such
broth, and just fancy, made only with a nail!</p>

<p>She was in such a good and merry humor at
having learned such an economical way of making
broth that she did not know how to make
enough of the tramp who had taught her such a
useful thing.</p>

<p>So they ate and drank, and drank and ate, until
they became both tired and sleepy.</p>

<p>The tramp was now going to lie down on the
floor. But that would never do, thought the old
woman; no, that was impossible. &ldquo;Such a grand
person must have a bed to lie in,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He did not need much pressing. &ldquo;It&#8217;s just like
the sweet Christmas time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a nicer
woman I never came across. Ah, well! Happy
are they who meet with such good people,&rdquo; said
he; and he lay down on the bed and went asleep.</p>

<p>And next morning, when he woke, the first
thing he got was a good breakfast.</p>

<p>When he was going, the old woman gave him
a bright dollar piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thanks, many thanks, for what you have
taught me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I shall live in comfort,
since I have learned how to make broth
with a nail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&#8217;t very difficult if one only has
something good to add to it,&rdquo; said the tramp as
he went his way.</p>

<p>The woman stood at the door staring after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such people don&#8217;t grow on every bush,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_WOMAN" id="OLD_WOMAN"></a>THE OLD WOMAN AND THE FISH</h2>


<p>There was once upon a time an old woman who
lived in a miserable cottage on the brow of a
hill overlooking the town. Her husband had been
dead for many years, and her children were in
service round about the parish, so she felt rather
lonely and dreary by herself, and otherwise she
was not particularly well off either.</p>

<p>But when it has been ordained that one shall
live, one cannot think of one&#8217;s funeral; and so
one has to take the world as it is, and still be satisfied;
and that was about all the old woman
could console herself with. But that the road up
which she had to carry the pails from the well
should be so heavy; and that the axe should have
such a blunt and rusty edge, so that it was only
with the greatest difficulty that she could cut the
little firewood she had; and that the stuff she
was weaving was not sufficient&mdash;all this grieved
her greatly, and caused her to complain from
time to time.</p>

<p>So one day, when she had pulled the bucket up
from the well, she happened to find a small pike
in the bucket, which did not at all displease
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such fish does not come into my pot every
day,&rdquo; she said; and now she could have a really
grand dish, she thought. But the fish that she
had got this time was no fool; it had the gift of
speech, that it had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; said the fish.</p>

<p>The old woman began to stare, you may be
sure. Such a fish she had never before seen in
this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so much better than other fish,
then?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and too good to be eaten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise is he who does not eat all he gets hold
of,&rdquo; said the fish; &ldquo;only let me go, and you shall
not remain without reward for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a fish in the bucket better than all those
frisking about free and frolicsome in the lakes,&rdquo;
said the old woman. &ldquo;And what one can catch
with one hand, one can also carry to one&#8217;s
mouth,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the fish; &ldquo;but if you do
as I tell you, you shall have three wishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish in one fist, and pour water in the other,
and you&#8217;ll soon see which you will get filled
first,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Promises are well
enough, but keeping them is better, and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
believe much in you till I have got you in the
pot,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should mind that tongue of yours,&rdquo; said
the fish, &ldquo;and listen to my words. Wish for three
things, and then you&#8217;ll see what will happen,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Well, the old woman knew well enough what
she wanted to wish, and there might not be so
much danger in trying how far the fish would
keep his word, she thought.</p>

<p>She then began thinking of the heavy hill up
from the well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would wish that the pails could go of themselves
to the well and home again,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they shall,&rdquo; said the fish.</p>

<p>Then she thought of the axe, and how blunt it
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would wish that whatever I strike shall
break right off,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it shall,&rdquo; said the fish.</p>

<p>And then she remembered that the stuff she
was weaving was not long enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would wish that whatever I pull shall become
long,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it shall,&rdquo; said the fish. &ldquo;And now, let
me down into the well again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, that she would, and all at once the pails
began to shamble up the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, did you ever see anything like it?&rdquo;
The old woman became so glad and pleased that
she slapped herself across the knees.</p>

<p>Crack, crack! it sounded; and then both her
legs fell off, and she was left sitting on the top
of the lid over the well.</p>

<p>Now came a change. She began to cry and
wail, and the tears started from her eyes, whereupon
she began blowing her nose with her apron,
and as she tugged at her nose it grew so long, so
long, that it was terrible to see.</p>

<p>That is what she got for her wishes! Well,
there she sat, and there she no doubt still sits, on
the lid of the well. And if you want to know
what it is to have a long nose, you had better
go there and ask her, for she can tell you all
about it, she can.</p>

<h2><a name="LAD" id="LAD"></a>THE LAD AND THE FOX</h2>


<p>There was once upon a time a little lad, who was
on his way to church, and when he came to a
clearing in the forest he caught sight of a fox
that was lying on the top of a big stone so fast
asleep that he did not know the lad had seen
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I catch that fox,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;and sell
the skin, I shall get money for it, and with that
money I shall buy some rye, and that rye I shall
sow in father&#8217;s corn-field at home. When the
people who are on their way to church pass by
my field of rye they&#8217;ll say: &lsquo;Oh, what splendid
rye that lad has got!&rsquo; Then I shall say to them:
&lsquo;I say, keep away from my rye!&rsquo; But they won&#8217;t
heed me. Then I shall shout to them: &lsquo;I say,
keep away from my rye!&rsquo; But still they won&#8217;t
take any notice of me. Then I shall scream with
all my might: &lsquo;Keep away from my rye!&rsquo; and
then they&#8217;ll listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the lad screamed so loudly that the fox
woke up and made off at once for the forest, so
that the lad did not even get as much as a handful
of his hair.</p>

<p>No; it&#8217;s best always to take what you can
reach, for of undone deeds you should never
screech, as the saying goes.</p>

<h2><a name="ASHPOT" id="ASHPOT"></a>ADVENTURES OF ASHPOT</h2>


<p>Norwegian children are just as fond of fairy
stories as are any other children, and they are
lucky in having a great number, for that famous
story-teller, Hans Christian Andersen, was a
Dane, and as the Danish language is very like
the Norwegian, his stories were probably known
in Norway long before they were known in England.
But the Norwegians have plenty of other
stories of their own, and they love to sit by the
fire of burning logs or round the stove in the
long winter evenings and listen to them. Of
course, they know all about people like Cinderella
and Jack the Giant-Killer, but their favorite
hero is called by the name of Ashpot, who is
sometimes a kind of boy Cinderella and sometimes
a Jack the Giant-Killer.</p>

<p>The following are two stories which the little
yellow-haired Norse children never fail to delight
in:</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a man who had
been out cutting wood, and when he came home
he found that he had left his coat behind, so he
told his little daughter to go and fetch it. The
child started off, but before she reached the wood
darkness came on, and suddenly a great big hill-giant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
swooped down upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Giant,&rdquo; said she, trembling all
over, &ldquo;don&#8217;t take me away to-night, as father
wants his coat; but to-morrow night, if you will
come when I go to the <em>stabbur</em> to fetch the bread,
I will go away with you quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the giant agreed, and the next night, when
she went to fetch the bread, he came and carried
her off. As soon as it was found that she was
missing, her father sent her eldest brother to
look for her, but he came back without finding
her. The second brother was also sent, but with
no better result. At last the father turned to his
youngest son, who was the drudge of the house,
and said: &ldquo;Now, Ashpot, you go and see if you
can find your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So away went Ashpot, and no sooner had he
reached the wood than he met a bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend bear,&rdquo; said Ashpot, &ldquo;will you help
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; answered the bear. &ldquo;Get up on
my back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Ashpot mounted the bear&#8217;s back and rode
off. Presently they met a wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend wolf,&rdquo; said Ashpot, &ldquo;will you do some
work for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; answered the wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then jump up behind,&rdquo; said Ashpot, and the
three went on deeper into the wood.</p>

<p>They next met a fox, and then a hare, both of
whom were enlisted into Ashpot&#8217;s service, and,
mounted on the back of the bear, were swiftly
carried off to the giant&#8217;s abode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mr. Giant!&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scratch my back!&rdquo; roared the giant, who lay
stretched in front of the fire warming himself.</p>

<p>The hare immediately climbed up and began to
scratch as desired; but the giant knocked him
over, and down he fell on to the hearthstone,
breaking off his forelegs, since which time all
hares have had short forelegs.</p>

<p>The fox next clambered up to scratch the
giant&#8217;s back, but he was served like the hare.
Then the wolf&#8217;s turn came, but the giant said
that he was no better at scratching than the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> scratch me!&rdquo; shouted the giant, turning
impatiently to the bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Bruin; &ldquo;I know all about
scratching,&rdquo; and he forthwith dug his claws into
the giant&#8217;s back and ripped it into a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p>Then all the beasts danced on the dead body
of the monster, and Ashpot recovered his sister
and took her home, carrying off, at the same time,
all the giant&#8217;s gold and silver. The bear and the
wolf burst into the cattle-sheds and devoured all
the cows and sheep, the fox feasted in the hen-roost,
while the hare had the free run of the oatfield.
So every one was satisfied.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The other story is also about Ashpot, whose
two elder brothers still treated him very badly,
and eventually turned him out of his home. Poor
Ashpot wandered away up into the mountains,
where he met a huge giant. At first he was terribly
afraid, but after a little while he told the
giant what had happened to him, and asked him
if he could find a job for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are just the very man I want,&rdquo; said the
giant. &ldquo;Come along with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first work to be done was to make a fire
to brew some ale, so they went off together to
the forest to cut firewood. The giant carried a
club in place of an axe, and when they came to
a large birch-tree he asked Ashpot whether he
would like to club the tree down or climb up and
hold the top of it. The boy thought that the latter
would suit him best, and he soon got up to the
topmost branches and held on to them. But the
giant gave the tree such a blow with his club as
to knock it right out of the ground, sending Ashpot
flying across the meadows into a marsh.
Luckily he landed on soft ground, and was none
the worse for his adventure; and they soon managed
to get the tree home, when they set to work
to make a fire.</p>

<p>But the wood was green, and would not burn,
so the giant began to blow. At the first puff Ashpot
found himself flying up to the ceiling as if
he had been a feather, but he managed to catch
hold of a piece of birch-bark among the rafters,
and on reaching the ground again he told the
giant that he had been up to get something to
make the fire burn.</p>

<p>The fire was soon burning splendidly, and the
giant commenced to brew the ale, drinking it off
as fast as it was made. Ashpot watched him
getting gradually stupid, and heard him mutter
to himself, &ldquo;To-night I will kill him,&rdquo; so he began
to think of a plan to outwit his master.
When he went to bed he placed the giant&#8217;s
cream-whisk, with which the giant used to beat
his cream, between the sheets as a dummy, while
Ashpot himself crept under the bedstead, where
he was safely hidden.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, just as he had expected,
he heard the giant come into his room,
and then there was a tremendous whack as the
giant brought his club down on to the bed. Next
morning the boy came out of his room as if nothing
had happened, and his master was very much
surprised to find him still alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;Didn&#8217;t you feel anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
in the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did feel something,&rdquo; said Ashpot; &ldquo;but I
thought that it was only a sausage-peg that had
fallen on the bed, so I went to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant was more astonished than ever, and
went off to consult his sister, who lived in a
neighboring mountain, and was about ten times
his size. At length it was settled that the giantess
should set her cooking-pot on the fire, and
that Ashpot should be sent to see her, when she
was to tip him into the caldron and boil him. In
the course of the day the giant sent the boy off
with a message to his sister, and when he reached
the giantess&#8217;s dwelling he found her busy cooking.
But he soon saw through her design, and
he took out of his pocket a nut with a hole in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, showing the nut to the
ogress, &ldquo;you think you can do everything. I
will tell you one thing that you can&#8217;t do: you
can&#8217;t make yourself so small as to be able to
creep into the hole in this nut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; replied the giantess. &ldquo;Of course
I can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment she became as small as a fly,
and crept into the nut, whereupon Ashpot hurled
it into the fire, and that was the end of the
giantess.</p>

<p>The boy was so delighted that he returned to
his old tyrant the giant and told him what had
happened to his sister. This set the big man
thinking again as to how he was to rid himself
of this sharp-witted little nuisance. He did not
understand boys, and he was afraid of Ashpot&#8217;s
tricks, so he offered him as much gold and silver
as he could carry if he would go away and
never return. Ashpot, however, replied that the
amount he could carry would not be worth having,
and that he could not think of going unless
he got as much as the giant could carry.</p>

<p>The giant, glad to get rid of him at any cost,
agreed, and, loading himself with gold and silver
and precious stones, he set out with the boy toward
his home. When they reached the outskirts
of the farms they saw a herd of cattle, and
the giant began to tremble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of beasts are these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are my father&#8217;s cows,&rdquo; replied Ashpot,
&ldquo;and you had better put down your burden and
run back to your mountain, or they may bite
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant was only too happy to get away, so,
depositing his load, which was as big as a small
hill, he made off, and left the boy to carry his
treasure home by himself.</p>

<p>So enormous was the amount of the valuables
that it was six years before Ashpot succeeded in
removing everything from the field where the
giant had set it down; but he and all his relations
were rich people for the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGENDS" id="LEGENDS"></a>NORWEGIAN BIRD-LEGENDS</h2>


<p>The Norwegians have several quaint old legends
connected with some of their birds. This
is the story of the goldcrest, known in Norway
as the &ldquo;bird-king&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Once upon a time the golden eagle determined
to be publicly acknowledged as king of the birds,
and he called a meeting of every kind of bird in
the world. As many of the birds would come
from tropical countries, he appointed a day in
the warmest month; and the place he chose was a
vast tract called Gr&ouml;nfjeld, where every species
of bird would feel at home, since it bordered on
the sea, yet was well provided with trees, shrubs,
flowers, rocks, sand, and heather, as well as with
lakes and rivers full of fish.</p>

<p>So on the morning of the great congress the
birds began to arrive in a steady stream, and by
noon every description of bird was represented&mdash;even
the ostrich, though how he contrived to
cross the seas the story does not say. The eagle
welcomed them, and when the last humming-bird
had settled down he addressed the meeting, saying
that there was no doubt that he had a right
to demand to be proclaimed their king. The
spread of his wings was prodigious, he could
fearlessly look at the sun, and to whatever height
he soared he could detect the slightest movement
of a fly on the earth.</p>

<p>But the birds objected to the eagle on account
of his plundering habits, and then each in turn
stated his own case as a claimant for the kingship&mdash;the
ostrich could run the fastest, the bird
of paradise and the peacock could look the prettiest,
the parrot could talk the best, the canary
could sing the sweetest, and every one of them,
for some reason or other, was in his own opinion
superior to his fellows. After several days of
fruitless discussion it was finally decided that
whichever bird could soar the highest should be,
once and for all, proclaimed king.</p>

<p>Every bird who could fly at all tried his best,
and the golden eagle, confident of success, waited
till last. Finally he spread his wings, and as he
did so an impudent little goldcrest hopped (unbeknown
to his great rival) on to his back. Up went
the eagle, and soon outdistanced every other bird.
Then, when he had almost reached the sun, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
shouted out, &ldquo;Well, here I am, the highest of all!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered the goldcrest, as, leaving the
eagle&#8217;s back, he fluttered upward, until suddenly
he knocked his head against the sun and set fire
to his crest. Stunned by the shock, the little upstart
fell headlong to the ground, but, soon recovering
himself, he immediately flew up on to the
royal rock and showed the golden crown which
he had assumed. Unanimously he was proclaimed
king of the birds, and by this name, concludes the
legend, he has ever since been known, his sunburnt
crest remaining as a proof of his cunning
and daring.</p>

<p>In those parts of Norway where the goldcrest is
rarely seen the same story, omitting the part
about the sun and the burnt crest, is told of the
common wren, who is said to have broken off his
tail in his great fall. And to this is applied the
moral: &ldquo;Proud and ambitious people sometimes
meet with an unexpected downfall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are at least seven kinds of woodpeckers
found in Norway, and of these the great black
woodpecker is the largest. The woodmen consider
it to be a bird which brings bad luck, and avoid
it as much as possible. They call it &ldquo;Gertrude&#8217;s
Bird&rdquo; because of the following legend:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Saviour once called on an old woman
who lived all alone in a little cottage in an extensive
forest in Norway. Her name was Gertrude,
and she was a hard, avaricious old creature, who
had not a kind word for anybody, and although
she was not badly off in a worldly point of view,
she was too stingy and selfish to assist any poor
wayfarer who by chance passed her cottage door.
One day our Lord happened to come that way,
and, being hungry and thirsty, he asked of Gertrude
a morsel of bread to eat and a cup of cold
water to drink. But the wicked old woman refused,
and turned our Saviour from the door with
harsh words. Our Lord stretched forth his hand
toward the aged crone, and, as a punishment, she
was immediately transformed into a black woodpecker;
and ever since that day the wicked old
creature has wandered about the world in the
shape of a bird, seeking her daily bread from
wood to wood and from tree to tree. The red
head of the bird is supposed to represent the red
nightcap worn by Gertrude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Legends of this description were doubtless introduced
in the early days of Christianity in order
to impress the new religion on the people,
and several have been preserved. Thus the turtle-dove
is revered as a bird which spoke kind
words to our Lord on the cross; and, similarly,
the swallow is said to have perched upon the
cross and to have pitied him; while the legend of
the crossbill relates how its beak became twisted
in endeavoring to withdraw the nails, and how
to this day it bears upon its plumage the red
blood-stains from the cross.</p>

<p>One more Christian legend&mdash;about the lapwing,
or peewit: The lapwing was at one time
a handmaiden of the Virgin Mary, and stole her
mistress&#8217;s scissors, for which she was transformed
into a bird, and condemned to wear a
forked tail resembling scissors. Moreover, the
lapwing was doomed forever and ever to fly
from tussock to tussock, uttering over and over
again the plaintive cry of &ldquo;Tyvit! tyvit!&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Thief! thief!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>In the old viking times, before Christianity
had found its way so far north, the bird which
influenced the people most was the raven. He
was credited with much knowledge, as well as
with the power to bring good or bad luck. One
of the titles of Odin was &ldquo;Raven-god,&rdquo; and he
had as messengers two faithful ravens, &ldquo;who
could speak all manner of tongues, and flew on
his behests to the uttermost parts of the earth.&rdquo;
In those days the figure of a raven was usually
emblazoned on shield and standard, and it was
thought that as the battle raged, victory or defeat
could be foreseen by the attitude assumed
by the embroidered bird on the standard. And
it is well known that William the Conqueror
(who came of viking stock) flew a banner with
raven device at the battle of Hastings where he
won such a great victory.</p>

<p>But the greatest use of all to which the sable
bird was put was to guide the roving pirates on
their expeditions. Before a start was made a
raven was let loose, and the direction of his
flight gave the viking ships their course. In
this manner, according to the old Norse legends,
did Floki discover Iceland; and many other extraordinary
things happened under the influence
of the raven.</p>

<h2>THE UGLY DUCKLING</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</strong></p>


<p>It was glorious out in the country. It was
summer, and the corn-fields were yellow, and the
oats were green; the hay had been put up in
stacks in the green meadows, and the stork went
about on his long red legs, and chattered Egyptian,
for this was the language he had learned from
his good mother. All around the fields and meadows
were great forests, and in the midst of these
forests lay deep lakes. Yes, it was really glorious
out in the country. In the midst of the sunshine
there lay an old farm, surrounded by deep canals,
and from the wall down to the water grew great
burdocks, so high that little children could stand
upright under the loftiest of them. It was just
as wild there as in the deepest wood. Here sat
a Duck upon her nest, for she had to hatch her
young ones; but she was almost tired out before
the little ones came; and then she so seldom had
visitors. The other ducks liked better to swim
about in the canals than to run up to sit down
under a burdock, and cackle with her.</p>

<p>At last one egg-shell after another burst open.
&ldquo;Piep! piep!&rdquo; it cried, and in all the eggs there
were little creatures that stuck out their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rap! rap!&rdquo; they said; and they all came rapping
out as fast as they could, looking all round
them under the green leaves; and the mother let
them look as much as they chose, for green is
good for the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How wide the world is!&rdquo; said the young
ones, for they certainly had much more room now
than when they were in the eggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think this is all the world?&rdquo; asked
the mother. &ldquo;That extends far across the other
side of the garden, quite into the parson&#8217;s field,
but I have never been there yet. I hope you
are all together,&rdquo; she continued, and stood up.
&ldquo;No, I have not all. The largest egg still lies
there. How long is this to last? I am really
tired of it.&rdquo; And she sat down again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how goes it?&rdquo; asked an old Duck who
had come to pay her a visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It lasts a long time with that one egg,&rdquo; said
the Duck who sat there. &ldquo;It will not burst.
Now, only look at the others; are they not the
prettiest ducks one could possibly see? They
are all like their father; the bad fellow never
comes to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the egg which will not burst,&rdquo;
said the old visitor. &ldquo;Believe me, it is a turkey&#8217;s
egg. I was once cheated in that way, and had
much anxiety and trouble with the young ones,
for they are afraid of the water. I could not
get them to venture in. I quacked and clucked,
but it was no use. Let me see the egg. Yes,
that&#8217;s a turkey egg! Let it lie there, and come
and teach the other children to swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will sit on it a little longer,&rdquo; said
the Duck. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve sat so long now that I can sit
a few days more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said the old Duck; and
she went away.</p>

<p>At last the great egg burst. &ldquo;Piep! piep!&rdquo;
said the little one, and crept forth. It was very
large and very ugly. The Duck looked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a very large duckling,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;none
of the others look like that: can it really be a
turkey chick? Now we shall soon find it out.
It must go into the water, even if I have to
thrust it in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the weather was splendidly bright,
and the sun shone on all the green trees. The
Mother-Duck went down to the water with all
her little ones. Splash she jumped into the water.
&ldquo;Quack! quack!&rdquo; she said, and one duckling after
another plunged in. The water closed over their
heads, but they came up in an instant, and swam
capitally; their legs went of themselves, and
there they were all in the water. The ugly gray
Duckling swam with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&#8217;s not a turkey,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;look how
well it can use its legs, and how upright it holds
itself. It is my own child! On the whole it&#8217;s
quite pretty, if one looks at it rightly. Quack!
quack! come with me, and I&#8217;ll lead you out into
the great world, and present you in the poultry-yard;
but keep close to me, so that no one may
tread on you, and take care of the cats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they came into the poultry-yard. There
was a terrible riot going on in there, for two
families were quarreling about an eel&#8217;s head, and
the cat got it after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, that&#8217;s how it goes in the world!&rdquo; said
the Mother-Duck; and she whetted her beak, for
she, too, wanted the eel&#8217;s head. &ldquo;Only use your
legs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See that you can bustle about,
and bow your heads before the old Duck yonder.
She&#8217;s the grandest of her tribe; she&#8217;s of Spanish
blood&mdash;that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s so fat; and do you
see, she has a red rag around her leg; that&#8217;s
something particularly fine, and the greatest distinction
a duck can enjoy; it signifies that one
does not want to lose her, and that she&#8217;s to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
recognized by man and beast. Shake yourselves&mdash;don&#8217;t
turn in your toes; a well-brought-up duck
turns its toes quite out, just like father and
mother, so! Now bend your necks and say
&lsquo;Rap&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they did so; but the other ducks round
about looked at them, and said quite boldly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there! now we&#8217;re to have these hanging
on, as if there were not enough of us already!
And&mdash;fie!&mdash;how that Duckling yonder looks; we
won&#8217;t stand that!&rdquo; And one duck flew up immediately,
and bit it in the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it alone,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;it does no
harm to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&#8217;s too large and peculiar,&rdquo; said
the Duck who had bitten it; &ldquo;and therefore it
must be buffeted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are pretty children that the mother has
there,&rdquo; said the old Duck with the rag on her leg.
&ldquo;They&#8217;re all pretty but that one; that was a
failure. I wish she could alter it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be done, my lady,&rdquo; replied the
Mother-Duck. &ldquo;It is not pretty, but it has a
really good disposition, and swims as well as any
other; I may even say it swims better. I think
it will grow up pretty, and become smaller in
time; it has lain too long in the egg, and therefore
is not properly shaped.&rdquo; And then she
pinched it in the neck, and smoothed its feathers.
&ldquo;Moreover, it is a drake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and therefore
it is not of so much consequence. I think
he will be very strong: he makes his way already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other ducklings are graceful enough,&rdquo;
said the old Duck. &ldquo;Make yourself at home;
and if you find an eel&#8217;s head, you may bring it
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now they were at home. But the poor
Duckling which had crept last out of the egg,
and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and
jeered, as much by the ducks as by the chickens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too big!&rdquo; they all said. And the turkey-cock,
who had been born with spurs, and therefore
thought himself an emperor, blew himself
up like a ship in full sail, and bore straight down
upon it; then he gobbled, and grew quite red in
the face. The poor Duckling did not know where
it should stand or walk; it was quite melancholy
because it looked ugly, and was scoffed at by
the whole yard.</p>

<p>So it went on the first day; and afterward it
became worse and worse. The poor Duckling was
hunted about by every one; even its brothers and
sisters were quite angry with it, and said: &ldquo;If
the cat would only catch you, you ugly creature!&rdquo;
And the mother said: &ldquo;If you were only far
away!&rdquo; And the ducks bit it, and the chickens
beat it, and the girl who had to feed the poultry
kicked at it with her foot.</p>

<p>Then it ran and flew over the fence, and the
little birds in the bushes flew up in fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because I am so ugly!&rdquo; thought the
Duckling; and it shut its eyes, but flew on farther;
thus it came out into the great moor, where the
wild ducks lived. Here it lay the whole night
long; and it was weary and downcast.</p>

<p>Toward morning the wild ducks flew up, and
looked at their new companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a one are you?&rdquo; they asked;
and the Duckling turned in every direction, and
bowed as well as it could. &ldquo;You are remarkably
ugly!&rdquo; said the wild ducks. &ldquo;But that is very
indifferent to us, so long as you do not marry
into our family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor thing! it certainly did not think of marrying,
and only hoped to obtain leave to lie among
the reeds and drink some of the swamp water.</p>

<p>Thus it lay two whole days; then came thither
two wild geese, or, properly speaking, two wild
ganders. It was not long since each had crept
out of an egg, and that&#8217;s why they were so
saucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, comrade,&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;You&#8217;re
so ugly that I like you. Will you go with us,
and become a bird of passage? Near here, in
another moor, there are a few sweet lovely wild
geese, all unmarried, and all able to say &lsquo;Rap&rsquo;!
You&#8217;ve a chance of making your fortune, ugly
as you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piff! paff!&rdquo; resounded through the air; and
the two ganders fell down dead in the swamp,
and the water became blood-red. &ldquo;Piff! paff!&rdquo;
it sounded again, and whole flocks of wild geese
rose up from the reeds. And then there was
another report. A great hunt was going on. The
hunters were lying in wait all round the moor,
and some were even sitting up in the branches
of the trees, which spread far over the reeds.
The blue smoke rose up like clouds among the
dark trees, and was wafted far away across the
water; and the hunting dogs came&mdash;splash,
splash!&mdash;into the swamp, and the rushes and the
reeds bent down on every side. That was a fright
for the poor Duckling! It turned its head, and
put it under its wing; but at that moment a
frightful great dog stood close by the Duckling.
His tongue hung far out of his mouth and his
eyes gleamed horrible and ugly; he thrust out his
nose close against the Duckling, showed his sharp
teeth, and&mdash;splash, splash!&mdash;on he went, without
seizing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven be thanked!&rdquo; sighed the Duckling.
&ldquo;I am so ugly that even the dog does not like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to bite me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled
through the reeds and gun after gun was fired.
At last, late in the day, silence was restored; but
the poor Duckling did not dare to rise up; it
waited several hours before it looked around,
and then hastened away out of the moor as fast
as it could. It ran on over field and meadow;
there was such a storm raging that it was difficult
to get from one place to another.</p>

<p>Toward evening the Duckling came to a miserable
little hut. This hut was so dilapidated that
it did not know on which side it should fall;
and that&#8217;s why it remained standing. The storm
whistled round the Duckling in such a way that
the poor creature was obliged to sit down, to
stand against it; and the tempest grew worse
and worse. Then the Duckling noticed that one
of the hinges of the door had given way, and
the door hung so slanting that the Duckling
could slip through the crack into the room.</p>

<p>Here lived a woman, with her Tom Cat and
her Hen. And the Tom Cat, whom she called
Sonnie, could arch his back and purr, he could
even give out sparks; but for that one had to
stroke his fur the wrong way. The Hen had
quite little short legs, and therefore she was
called Chickabiddy-shortshanks; she laid good
eggs, and the woman loved her as her own child.</p>

<p>In the morning the strange Duckling was at
once noticed, and the Tom Cat began to purr,
and the Hen to cluck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s this?&rdquo; said the woman, looking all
around; but she could not see very well, and
therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat
duck that had strayed. &ldquo;This is a rare prize!&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Now I shall have duck&#8217;s eggs. I
hope it is not a drake. We must try that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the Duckling was admitted on trial
for three weeks; but no eggs came. And the
Tom Cat was master of the house, and the Hen
was the lady, and always said, &ldquo;We and the
world!&rdquo; for she thought they were half the world,
and by far the better half. The Duckling thought
one might have a different opinion, but the Hen
would not allow it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you lay eggs?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&#8217;ll have the goodness to hold your
tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Tom Cat said, &ldquo;Can you curve your
back, and purr and give out sparks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you cannot have any opinion of your
own when sensible people are speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Duckling sat in the corner and was
melancholy; then the fresh air and the sunshine
streamed in; and it was seized with such a strange
longing to swim on the water, that it could not
help telling the Hen of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; cried the Hen.
&ldquo;You have nothing to do, that&#8217;s why you have
these fancies. Purr or lay eggs, and they will
pass over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is so charming to swim on the water!&rdquo;
said the Duckling, &ldquo;so refreshing to let it close
above one&#8217;s head, and to dive to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure, truly,&rdquo;
quoth the Hen. &ldquo;I fancy you must have gone
crazy. Ask the Cat about it&mdash;he&#8217;s the cleverest
animal I know&mdash;ask him if he likes to swim on
the water, or to dive down; I won&#8217;t speak about
myself. Ask our mistress, the old woman; no
one in the world is cleverer than she. Do you
think she has any desire to swim, and to let the
water close above her head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t understand me,&rdquo; said the Duckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t understand you? Then pray who
is to understand you? You surely don&#8217;t pretend
to be cleverer than the Tom Cat and the woman&mdash;I
won&#8217;t say anything of myself. Don&#8217;t be conceited,
child, and be grateful for all the kindness
you have received. Did you not get into a warm
room, and have you not fallen into company from
which you may learn something. But you are a
chatterer, and it is not pleasant to associate with
you. You may believe me, I speak for your
good. I tell you disagreeable things, and by that
one may always know one&#8217;s true friends! Only
take care that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr
and give out sparks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will go out into the wide world,&rdquo;
said the Duckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do go,&rdquo; replied the Hen.</p>

<p>And the Duckling went away. It swam on the
water, and dived, but it was slighted by every
creature because of its ugliness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;have you not fallen into company from<br />

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now came the Autumn. The leaves in the forest
turned yellow and brown; the wind caught
them so that they danced about, and up in the air
it was very cold. The clouds hung low, heavy
with hail and snow-flakes, and on the fence stood
the raven, crying, &ldquo;Croak! croak!&rdquo; for mere
cold; yes, it was enough to make one feel cold
to think of this. The poor little Duckling certainly
had not a good time. One evening&mdash;the
sun was just setting in his beauty&mdash;there came a
whole flock of great handsome birds out of the
bushes; they were dazzlingly white, with long
flexible necks; they were swans. They uttered a
very peculiar cry, spread forth their glorious
great wings, and flew away from that cold region
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to warmer lands, to fair open lakes. They
mounted so high, so high! and the ugly little
Duckling felt quite strangely as it watched them.
It turned round and round in the water like a
wheel, stretched out its neck toward them, and
uttered such a strange loud cry as frightened itself.
Oh! it could not forget those beautiful,
happy birds; and as soon as it could see them
no longer, it dived down to the very bottom, and
when it came up again, it was quite beside itself.
It knew not the name of those birds, and knew
not whither they were flying; but it loved them
more than it had ever loved any one. It was
not at all envious of them. How could it think
of wishing to possess such loveliness as they
had? It would have been glad if only the ducks
would have endured its company.</p>

<p>And the Winter grew cold, very cold! The
Duckling was forced to swim about in the water,
to prevent the surface from freezing entirely; but
every night the hole in which it swam about became
smaller and smaller. It froze so hard that
the icy covering cracked again; and the Duckling
was obliged to use its legs continually to prevent
the hole from freezing up. At last it became exhausted,
and lay quite still, and thus froze fast
into the ice.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a peasant came by, and
when he saw what had happened, he took his
wooden shoe, broke the ice-crust to pieces, and
carried the Duckling home to his wife. Then it
came to itself again. The children wanted to play
with it, but the Duckling thought they would
do it an injury, and in its terror fluttered up into
the milk-pan, so that the milk spurted down into
the room. The woman clapped her hands, at
which the Duckling flew down into the butter-tub,
and then into the meal-barrel and out again.
How it looked then! The woman screamed, and
struck at it with the fire-tongs; the children
tumbled over one another, in their efforts to
catch the Duckling; and they laughed and
screamed finely! Happily the door stood open,
and the poor creature was able to slip out between
the shrubs into the newly fallen snow;
and there it lay quite exhausted.</p>

<p>But it would be too melancholy if I were to
tell all the misery and want which the Duckling
had to endure in the hard Winter. It lay out on
the moor among the reeds, when the sun began
to shine again and the larks to sing: it was a
beautiful Spring.</p>

<p>Then all at once the Duckling could flap its
wings: they beat the air more strongly than before,
and bore it strongly away; and before it
well knew how all this happened, it found itself
in a great garden, where the elder trees smelt
sweet, and bent their long green branches down
to the canal that wound through the region.
Oh, here it was so beautiful, such a gladness of
Spring! and from the thicket came three glorious
white swans; they rustled their wings, and swam
lightly on the water. The Duckling knew the
splendid creatures, and felt oppressed by a peculiar
sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will fly away to them, to the royal birds!
and they will kill me, because I, that am so
ugly, dare to approach them. But it is of no
consequence! Better to be killed by <em>them</em> than
to be pursued by ducks, and beaten by fowls, and
pushed about by the girl who takes care of the
poultry-yard, and to suffer hunger in Winter!&rdquo;
And it flew out into the water, and swam toward
the beautiful swans: these looked at it, and came
sailing down upon it with outspread wings. &ldquo;Kill
me!&rdquo; said the poor creature, and bent its head
down upon the water, expecting nothing but death.
But what was this that it saw in the clear water?
It beheld its own image; and, lo! it was no
longer a clumsy, dark-gray bird, ugly and hateful
to look at, but&mdash;a swan!</p>

<p>It matters nothing if one is born in a duck-yard,
if one has only lain in a swan&#8217;s egg.</p>

<p>It felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune
it had suffered, now it realized its happiness in
all the splendor that surrounded it. And the
great swans swam around it, and stroked it with
their beaks.</p>

<p>Into the garden came little children, who threw
bread and corn into the water; and the youngest
cried: &ldquo;There is a new one!&rdquo; And the other
children shouted joyously: &ldquo;Yes, a new one has
arrived!&rdquo; And they clapped their hands and
danced about, and ran to their father and mother;
and bread and cake were thrown into the water;
and they all said: &ldquo;The new one is the most
beautiful of all! so young and handsome!&rdquo; And
the old swans bowed their heads before him.</p>

<p>Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head
under his wings, for he did not know what to
do; he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.
He thought how he had been persecuted and
despised; and now he heard them saying that
he was the most beautiful of all birds. Even
the elder tree bent its branches straight down into
the water before him, and the sun shone
warm and mild. Then his wings rustled, he
lifted his slender neck, and cried rejoicingly from
the depths of his heart:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of so much happiness when
I was still the Ugly Duckling!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE WILD SWANS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN</strong></p>


<p>Far away, where the swallows fly when our
Winter comes on, lived a King who had eleven
sons, and one daughter named Eliza. The eleven
brothers were Princes, and each went to school
with a star on his breast and his sword by his
side. They wrote with pencils of diamond upon
slates of gold, and learned by heart just as well
as they read: one could see directly that they
were Princes. Their sister Eliza sat upon a little
stool of plate-glass, and had a picture-book which
had been bought for the value of half a kingdom.</p>

<p>Oh, the children were particularly well off; but
it was not always to remain so.</p>

<p>Their father, who was King of the whole
country, married a bad Queen, who did not love
the poor children at all. On the very first day
they could notice this. In the whole palace there
was great feasting, and the children were playing
there. Then guests came; but instead of the
children receiving, as they had been accustomed
to do, all the spare cake and all the roasted
apples, they only had some sand given them in
a tea-cup, and were told that they might make
believe that was something good. The next week
the Queen took the little sister Eliza into the
country, to a peasant and his wife; and but a
short time had elapsed before she told the King
so many falsehoods about the poor Princes that
he did not trouble himself any more about them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly out into the world and get your own
living,&rdquo; said the wicked Queen. &ldquo;Fly like great
birds without a voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she could not make it so bad for them as
she had intended, for they became eleven magnificent
wild swans. With a strange cry they
flew out of the palace windows, far over the park
and into the wood.</p>

<p>It was yet quite early morning when they came
by the place where their sister Eliza lay asleep
in the peasant&#8217;s room. Here they hovered over
the roof, turned their long necks, and flapped
their wings; but no one heard or saw it. They
were obliged to fly on, high up toward the clouds,
far away into the wide world; there they flew
into a great dark wood, which stretched away
to the seashore.</p>

<p>Poor little Eliza stood in the peasant&#8217;s room
and played with a green leaf, for she had no
other playthings. And she pricked a hole in the
leaf, and looked through it up at the sun, and it
seemed to her that she saw her brothers&#8217; clear
eyes; each time the warm sun shone upon her
cheeks she thought of all the kisses they had
given her.</p>

<p>Each day passed just like the rest. When the
wind swept through the great rose hedges outside
the house, it seemed to whisper to them:
&ldquo;What can be more beautiful than you?&rdquo; But
the roses shook their heads and answered &ldquo;Eliza!&rdquo;
And when the old woman sat in front of her
door on Sunday and read in her hymn-book, the
wind turned the leaves and said to the book:
&ldquo;Who can be more pious than you?&rdquo; and the
hymn-book said, &ldquo;Eliza!&rdquo; And what the rose
bushes and the hymn-book said was the simple
truth.</p>

<p>When she was 15 years old she was to go
home. And when the Queen saw how beautiful
she was, she became spiteful and filled with
hatred toward her. She would have been glad
to change her into a wild swan, like her brothers,
but she did not dare to do so at once, because
the King wished to see his daughter.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the Queen went into the
bath, which was built of white marble, and decked
with soft cushions and the most splendid tapestry;
and she took three toads and kissed them, and
said to the first: &ldquo;Sit upon Eliza&#8217;s head when
she comes into the bath, that she may become
as stupid as you. Seat yourself upon her forehead,&rdquo;
she said to the second, &ldquo;that she may
become as ugly as you, and her father may not
know her. Rest on her heart,&rdquo; she whispered
to the third, &ldquo;that she may receive an evil mind
and suffer pain from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she put the toads into the clear water,
which at once assumed a green color; and calling
Eliza, she caused her to undress and step into
the water. And while Eliza dived, one of the
toads sat upon her hair, and the second on her
forehead, and the third on her heart; but she
did not seem to notice it; and as soon as she
rose, three red poppies were floating on the
water. If the creatures had not been poisonous,
and if the witch had not kissed them, they would
have been changed into red roses. But at any
rate they became flowers, because they had rested
on the girl&#8217;s head, and forehead, and heart. She
was too good and innocent for sorcery to have
power over her.</p>

<p>When the wicked Queen saw that, she rubbed
Eliza with walnut juice, so that the girl became
dark brown, and smeared a hurtful ointment on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
her face, and let her beautiful hair hang in confusion.
It was quite impossible to recognize the
pretty Eliza.</p>

<p>When her father saw her he was much shocked
and declared this was not his daughter. No one
but the yard dog and the swallows would recognize
her; but they were poor animals who had
nothing to say in the matter.</p>

<p>Then poor Eliza wept, and thought of her
eleven brothers who were all away. Sorrowfully
she crept out of the castle, and walked all day
over field and moor till she came into the great
wood. She did not know whither she wished to
go, only she felt very downcast and longed for
her brothers: they had certainly been, like herself,
thrust forth into the world, and she would
seek for them and find them.</p>

<p>She had been only a short time in the wood
when the night fell; she quite lost the path, therefore
she lay down upon the soft moss, prayed
her evening prayer, and leaned her head against
the stump of a tree. Deep silence reigned around,
the air was mild, and in the grass and in the
moss gleamed like a green fire hundreds of glow-worms;
when she lightly touched one of the
twigs with her hand, the shining insects fell
down upon her like shooting stars.</p>

<p>The whole night long she dreamed of her
brothers. They were children again playing together,
writing with their diamond pencils upon
their golden slates, and looking at the beautiful
picture-book which had cost half a kingdom. But
on the slates they were not writing as they had
been accustomed to do, lines and letters, but the
brave deeds they had done, and all they had seen
and experienced; and in the picture-book everything
was alive&mdash;the birds sang, and the people
went out of the book and spoke with Eliza and
her brothers. But when the leaf was turned,
they jumped back again directly, so that there
should be no confusion.</p>

<p>When she awoke the sun was already standing
high. She could certainly not see it, for the
lofty trees spread their branches far and wide
above her. But the rays played there above like
a gauzy veil, there was a fragrance from the
fresh verdure, and the birds almost perched upon
her shoulders. She heard the splashing of water;
it was from a number of springs all flowing into
a lake which had the most delightful sandy bottom.
It was surrounded by thick growing bushes,
but at one part the stags had made a large
opening, and here Eliza went down to the water.
The lake was so clear, that if the wind had not
stirred the branches and the bushes, so that they
moved, one would have thought they were painted
upon the depths of the lake, so clearly was every
leaf mirrored, whether the sun shone upon it
or whether it lay in shadow.</p>

<p>When Eliza saw her own face she was terrified&mdash;so
brown and ugly was she; but when she
wetted her little hand and rubbed her eyes and
her forehead, the white skin gleamed forth again.
Then she undressed and went down into the fresh
water; a more beautiful King&#8217;s daughter than
she was could not be found in the world. And
when she had dressed herself again and plaited
her long hair, she went to the bubbling spring,
drank out of the hollow of her hand, and then
wandered far into the wood, not knowing whither
she went. She thought of her dear brothers, and
thought that Heaven would certainly not forsake
her. It is God who lets the wild apples grow,
to satisfy the hunger. He showed her a wild
apple tree, with the boughs bending under the
weight of the fruit. Here she took her midday
meal, placing props under the boughs, and then
went into the darkest part of the forest. There
it was so still that she could hear her own footsteps,
as well as the rustling of every dry leaf
which bent under her feet. Not one bird was
to be seen, not one ray of sunlight could find
its way through the great dark boughs of the
trees; the lofty trunks stood so close together
that when she looked before her it appeared as
though she were surrounded by sets of palings
one behind the other.</p>

<p>The night came on quite dark. Not a single
glow-worm now gleamed in the grass. Sorrowfully
she lay down to sleep. Then it seemed
to her as if the branches of the trees parted above
her head, and mild eyes of angels looked down
upon her from on high.</p>

<p>When the morning came, she did not know if
it had really been so or if she had dreamed it.</p>

<p>She went a few steps forward, and then she
met an old woman with berries in her basket,
and the old woman gave her a few of them.
Eliza asked the dame if she had not seen eleven
Princes riding through the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the old woman, &ldquo;but yesterday
I saw eleven swans swimming in the river close
by, with golden crowns on their heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she led Eliza a short distance farther, to
a declivity, and at the foot of the slope a little
river wound its way. The trees on its margin
stretched their long leafy branches across toward
each other, and where their natural growth would
not allow them to come together, the roots had
been torn out of the ground, and hung, intermingled
with the branches, over the water.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;the whole day they flew onward through the air&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eliza said farewell to the old woman, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
went beside the river to the place where the
stream flowed out to the great open ocean.</p>

<p>The whole glorious sea lay before the young
girl&#8217;s eyes, but not one sail appeared on its surface,
and not a boat was to be seen. How was
she to proceed? She looked at the innumerable
little pebbles on the shore; the water had worn
them all round. Glass, ironstones, everything
that was there had received its shape from the
water, which was much softer than even her
delicate hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It rolls on unweariedly, and thus what is hard
becomes smooth. I will be just as unwearied.
Thanks for your lesson, you clear rolling waves;
my heart tells me that one day you will lead
me to my dear brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the foam-covered sea-grass lay eleven white
swan feathers, which she collected into a bunch.
Drops of water were upon them&mdash;whether they
were dewdrops or tears nobody could tell. Solitary
it was there on the strand, but she did not
feel it, for the sea showed continual changes&mdash;more
in a few hours than the lovely lakes can
produce in a whole year. Then a great black
cloud came. It seemed as if the sea would say:
&ldquo;I can look angry, too.&rdquo; And then the wind
blew, and the waves turned their white side outward.
But when the clouds gleamed red and the
winds slept, the sea looked like a rose-leaf; sometimes
it became green, sometimes white. But
however quietly it might rest, there was still a
slight motion on the shore; the water rose gently
like the breast of a sleeping child.</p>

<p>When the sun was just about to set, Eliza
saw eleven wild swans, with crowns on their
heads, flying toward the land: they swept along
one after the other, so that they looked like a
long white band. Then Eliza descended the slope
and hid herself behind a bush. The swans
alighted near her and flapped their great white
wings.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun had disappeared beneath
the water, the swan&#8217;s feathers fell off, and eleven
handsome Princes, Eliza&#8217;s brothers, stood there.
She uttered a loud cry, for although they were
greatly altered, she knew and felt that it must
be they. And she sprang into their arms and
called them by their names; and the Princes felt
supremely happy when they saw their little sister
again; and they knew her, though she was now
tall and beautiful. They smiled and wept; and
soon they understood how cruel their stepmother
had been to them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We brothers,&rdquo; said the eldest, "fly about as
wild swans as long as the sun is in the sky, but
directly it sinks down we receive our human form
again. Therefore we must always take care that
we have a resting-place for our feet when the
sun sets; for if at that moment we were flying
up toward the clouds, we should sink down into
the deep as men. We do not dwell here: there
lies a land just as fair as this beyond the sea.
But the way thither is long; we must cross the
great sea, and on our path there is no island
where we could pass the night, only a little rock
stands forth in the midst of the waves; it is just
large enough that we can rest upon it close to
each other. If the sea is rough, the foam spurts
far over us, but we thank God for the rock.
There we pass the night in our human form:
but for this rock we could never visit our beloved
native land, for we require two of the longest
days in the year for our journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only once in each year is it granted to us to
visit our home. For eleven days we may stay
here and fly over the great wood, from whence
we can see the palace in which we were born
and in which our father lives, and the high
church tower, beneath whose shade our mother
lies buried. Here it seems to us as though the
bushes and trees were our relatives; here the
wild horses career across the steppe, as we have
seen them do in our childhood; here the charcoal-burner
sings the old songs to which we danced as
children; here is our fatherland; hither we feel
ourselves drawn, and here we have found you,
our dear little sister. Two days more we may
stay here; then we must away across the sea to
a glorious land, but which is not our native land.
How can we bear you away? for we have neither
ship nor boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way can I release you?&rdquo; asked the
sister; and they conversed nearly the whole night,
slumbering only for a few hours.</p>

<p>She was awakened by the rustling of the
swans&#8217; wings above her head. Her brothers
were again enchanted, and they flew in wide
circles and at last far away; but one of them,
the youngest, remained behind, and the swan
laid his head in her lap, and she stroked his
wings; and the whole day they remained together.
Toward evening the others came back, and when
the sun had gone down they stood there in their
own shapes, and one of them said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow we fly far away from here, and
cannot come back until a whole year has gone by.
But we cannot leave you thus! Have you courage
to come with us? My arm is strong enough
to carry you in the wood; and should not all our
wings be strong enough to fly with you over the
sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, take me with you,&rdquo; said Eliza.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
The whole night they were occupied in weaving
a net of the pliable willow bark and tough
reeds; and it was great and strong. On this
net Eliza lay down; and when the sun rose, and
her brothers were changed into wild swans, they
seized the net with their beaks, and flew with
their beloved sister, who was still asleep, high up
toward the clouds. The sunbeams fell exactly
upon her face, so one of the swans flew over her
head, that his broad wings might overshadow her.</p>

<p>They were far away from the shore when
Eliza awoke: she was still dreaming, so strange
did it appear to her to be carried high through
the air and over the sea. By her side lay a
branch with beautiful ripe berries and a bundle
of sweet-tasting roots. The youngest of the
brothers had collected them and placed them there
for her. She smiled at him thankfully, for she
recognized him; he it was who flew over her
and shaded her with his wings.</p>

<p>They were so high that the greatest ship they
descried beneath them seemed like a white sea-gull
lying upon the waters. A great cloud stood
behind them&mdash;it was a perfect mountain; and
upon it Eliza saw her own shadow and those of
the eleven swans; there they flew on, gigantic
in size. Here was a picture, a more splendid
one than she had ever yet seen. But as the sun
rose higher and the cloud was left farther behind
them, the floating shadowy images vanished
away.</p>

<p>The whole day they flew onward through the
air, like a whirring arrow, but their flight was
slower than it was wont to be, for they had
their sister to carry. Bad weather came on;
the evening drew near; Eliza looked anxiously
at the setting sun, for the lonely rock in the
ocean could not be seen. It seemed to her as
if the swans beat the air more strongly with their
wings. Alas! she was the cause that they did
not advance fast enough. When the sun went
down, they must become men and fall into the
sea and drown. Then she prayed a prayer from
the depths of her heart; but still she could descry
no rock. The dark clouds came nearer in a
great black threatening body rolling forward like
a mass of lead, and the lightning burst forth,
flash upon flash.</p>

<p>Now the sun just touched the margin of the
sea. Eliza&#8217;s heart trembled. Then the swans
darted downward, so swiftly that she thought
they were falling, but they paused again. The
sun was half hidden below the water. And now
for the first time she saw the little rock beneath
her, and it looked no larger than a seal might
look, thrusting his head forth from the water.
The sun sank very fast; at last it appeared only
like a star; and then her foot touched the firm
land. The sun was extinguished like the last
spark in a piece of burned paper; her brothers
were standing around her, arm in arm, but there
was not more than just enough room for her and
for them. The sea beat against the rock and
went over her like fine rain; the sky glowed
in continual fire, and peal on peal the thunder
rolled; but sister and brothers held each other
by the hand and sang psalms, from which they
gained comfort and courage.</p>

<p>In the morning twilight the air was pure and
calm. As soon as the sun rose the swans flew
away with Eliza from the island. The sea still
ran high, and when they soared up aloft, from
their high position the white foam on the dark
green waves looked like millions of white swans
swimming upon the water.</p>

<p>When the sun mounted higher, Eliza saw before
her, half floating in the air, a mountainous
country with shining masses of ice on its water,
and in the midst of it rose a castle, apparently
a mile long, with row above row of elegant columns,
while beneath waved the palm woods and
bright flowers as large as mill-wheels. She asked
if this was the country to which they were bound,
but the swans shook their heads, for what she
beheld was the gorgeous, everchanging palace of
Fata Morgana, and into this they might bring
no human being. As Eliza gazed at it, mountains,
woods, and castle fell down, and twenty proud
churches, all nearly alike, with high towers and
pointed windows, stood before them. She fancied
she heard the organs sounding, but it was the sea
she heard. When she was quite near the churches
they changed to a fleet sailing beneath her, but
when she looked down it was only a sea mist
gliding over the ocean. Thus she had a continual
change before her eyes, till at last she saw the
real land to which they were bound. There
arose the most glorious blue mountains, with
cedar forests, cities, and palaces. Long before
the sun went down she sat on the rock, in front
of a great cave overgrown with delicate green
trailing plants looking like embroidered carpets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we shall see what you will dream of
here to-night,&rdquo; said the youngest brother; and
he showed her to her bed-chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant that I may dream of a way to
release you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>And this thought possessed her mightily, and
she prayed ardently for help; yes, even in her
sleep she continued to pray. Then it seemed to
her as if she were flying high in the air to the
cloudy palace of Fata Morgana; and the fairy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
came out to meet her, beautiful and radiant; and
yet the fairy was quite like the old woman who
had given her the berries in the wood, and had
told her of the swans with golden crowns on
their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brothers can be released,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;But have you courage and perseverance? Certainly,
water is softer than your delicate hands,
and yet it changes the shape of stones but it
feels not the pain that your fingers will feel;
it has no heart, and cannot suffer the agony and
torment you will have to endure. Do you see
the stinging nettle which I hold in my hand?
Many of the same kind grow around the cave in
which you sleep: those only, and those that grow
upon churchyard graves, are serviceable, remember
that. Those you must pluck, though they will
burn your hands into blisters. Break these nettles
to pieces with your feet, and you will have flax;
of this you must plait and weave eleven shirts
of mail with long sleeves: throw these over the
eleven swans, and the charm will be broken. But
recollect well, from the moment you begin this
work until it is finished, even though it should
take years to accomplish, you must not speak.
The first word you utter will pierce your brothers&#8217;
hearts like a deadly dagger. Their lives
hang on your tongue. Remember all this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she touched her hand with the nettle; it
was like a burning fire, and Eliza awoke with the
smart. It was broad daylight; and close by the
spot where she had slept lay a nettle like the
one she had seen in her dream. She fell upon
her knees and prayed gratefully, and went forth
from the cave to begin her work.</p>

<p>With her delicate hands she groped among the
ugly nettles. These stung like fire, burning great
blisters on her arms and hands; but she thought
she would bear it gladly if she could only release
her dear brothers. Then she bruised every
nettle with her bare feet and plaited the green
flax.</p>

<p>When the sun had set her brothers came, and
they were frightened when they found her dumb.
They thought it was some new sorcery of their
wicked stepmother&#8217;s; but when they saw her
hands, they understood what she was doing for
their sake, and the youngest brother wept. And
where his tears dropped she felt no more pain
and the burning blisters vanished.</p>

<p>She passed the night at her work, for she
could not sleep till she had delivered her dear
brothers. The whole of the following day, while
the swans were away, she sat in solitude, but
never had time flown so quickly with her as now.
One shirt of mail was already finished, and now
she began the second.</p>

<p>Then a hunting horn sounded among the hills,
and she was struck with fear. The noise came
nearer and nearer; she heard the barking dogs,
and timidly she fled into the cave, bound into a
bundle the nettles she had collected and prepared,
and sat upon the bundle.</p>

<p>Immediately a great dog came bounding out
of the ravine, and then another, and another:
they barked loudly, ran back, and then came
again. Only a few minutes had gone before all
the huntsmen stood before the cave, and the
handsomest of them was the King of the country.
He came forward to Eliza, for he had never
seen a more beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come hither, you delightful
child?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Eliza shook her head, for she might not speak&mdash;it
would cost her brothers their deliverance
and their lives. And she hid her hands under
her apron, so that the King might not see what
she was suffering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You cannot stop
here. If you are as good as you are beautiful,
I will dress you in velvet and silk, and place
the golden crown on your head, and you shall
dwell in my richest castle, and rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he lifted her on his horse. She
wept and wrung her hands; but the King said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish for your happiness: one day you
will thank me for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he galloped away among the mountains
with her on his horse, and the hunters
galloped at their heels.</p>

<p>When the sun went down, the fair regal city
lay before them, with its churches and cupolas;
and the King led her into the castle, where great
fountains plashed in the lofty marble halls, and
where walls and ceilings were covered with
glorious pictures. But she had no eyes for all this&mdash;she
only wept and mourned. Passively she
let the women put royal robes upon her, and
weave pearls in her hair, and draw dainty gloves
over her blistered fingers.</p>

<p>When she stood there in full array, she was
dazzlingly beautiful, so that the Court bowed
deeper than ever. And the King chose her for
his bride, although the archbishop shook his head
and whispered that the beauteous fresh maid was
certainly a witch, who blinded the eyes and led
astray the heart of the King.</p>

<p>But the King gave no ear to this, but ordered
that the music should sound, and the costliest
dishes should be served, and the most beautiful
maidens should dance before them. And she was
led through fragrant gardens into gorgeous halls;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
but never a smile came upon her lips or shone
in her eyes; there she stood, a picture of grief.
Then the King opened a little chamber close by,
where she was to sleep. This chamber was
decked with splendid green tapestry, and completely
resembled the cave in which she had been.
On the floor lay the bundle of flax which she
had prepared from the nettles, and under the
ceiling hung the shirt of mail she had completed.
All these things one of the huntsmen had brought
with him as curiosities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you may dream yourself back in your
former home,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Here is the work
which occupied you there, and now, in the midst
of all your splendor, it will amuse you to think
of that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Eliza saw this that lay so near her
heart, a smile played round her mouth and the
crimson blood came back into her cheeks. She
thought of her brothers&#8217; deliverance, and kissed
the King&#8217;s hand; and he pressed her to his heart,
and caused the marriage feast to be announced
by all the church bells. The beautiful dumb girl
out of the wood became the Queen of the country.</p>

<p>Then the archbishop whispered evil words into
the King&#8217;s ear, but they did not sink into the
King&#8217;s heart. The marriage was to take place;
the archbishop himself was obliged to place the
crown on her head, and with wicked spite he
pressed the narrow circlet so tightly upon her
brow that it pained her. But a heavier ring lay
close around her heart&mdash;sorrow for her brothers;
she did not feel the bodily pain. Her mouth was
dumb, for a single word would cost her brothers
their lives, but her eyes glowed with love for
the kind, handsome King, who did everything to
rejoice her. She loved him with her whole heart,
more and more every day. Oh, that she had
been able to confide in him and to tell him of
her grief; but she was compelled to be dumb,
and to finish her work in silence. Therefore at
night she crept away from his side, and went
quietly into the little chamber which was decorated
like the cave, and wove one shirt of mail
after another. But when she began the seventh
she found that she had no flax left.</p>

<p>She knew that in the churchyard nettles were
growing that she could use; but she must pluck
them herself, and how was she to go out there
unseen?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is the pain in my fingers to the
torment my heart endures?&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;I must
venture it, and help will not be denied me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a trembling heart, as though the deed
she purposed doing had been evil, she crept into
the garden in the moonlight night, and went
through the lanes and through the deserted streets
to the churchyard. There, on one of the broadest
tombstones she saw sitting a circle of lamias.
These hideous wretches took off their ragged
garments, as if they were going to bathe; then
with their skinny fingers they clawed open the
fresh graves, and with fiendish greed they
snatched up the corpses and ate the flesh. Eliza
was obliged to pass close by them and they
fastened their evil glances upon her; but she
prayed silently, and collected the burning nettles,
and carried them into the castle.</p>

<p>Only one person had seen her, and that was
the archbishop. He was awake while others
slept. Now he felt sure his opinion was correct,
that all was not as it should be with the Queen;
she was a witch.</p>

<p>In secret he told the King what he had seen
and what he feared; and when the hard words
came from his tongue, the pictures of saints in
the cathedral shook their heads, as though they
could have said: &ldquo;It is not so! Eliza is innocent!&rdquo;
But the archbishop interpreted this differently&mdash;he
thought they were bearing witness
against her, and shaking their heads at her sinfulness.
Then two heavy tears rolled down the
King&#8217;s cheeks; he went home with doubt in his
heart, and at night pretended to be asleep; but
no real sleep came upon his eyes, for he noticed
that Eliza got up. Every night she did this, and
each time he followed her silently, and saw how
she disappeared from her chamber.</p>

<p>From day to day his face became darker. Eliza
saw it, but did not understand the reason; but
it frightened her&mdash;and what did she not suffer in
her heart for her brothers? Her hot tears flowed
upon the royal velvet and purple; they lay there
like sparkling diamonds, and all who saw the
splendor wished they were Queens. In the meantime
she had almost finished her work. Only one
shirt of mail was still to be completed, but she
had no flax left, and not a single nettle. Once
more, for the last time, therefore, she must go
to the churchyard, only to pluck a few handfuls.
She thought with terror of this solitary wandering
and of the horrible lamias, but her will was
firm as her trust in Providence.</p>

<p>Eliza went on, but the King and the archbishop
followed her. They saw her vanish into the
churchyard through the wicket gate; and when
they drew near, the lamias were sitting upon the
gravestones as Eliza had seen them; and the
King turned aside, for he fancied her among
them, whose head had rested against his breast
that very evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people must condemn her,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
And the people condemned her to suffer death
by fire.</p>

<p>Out of the gorgeous regal halls she was led
into a dark damp cell, where the wind whistled
through the grated window; instead of velvet
and silk they gave her the bundle of nettles
which she had collected: on this she could lay
her head; and the hard burning coats of mail
which she had woven were to be her coverlet.
But nothing could have been given her that she
liked better. She resumed her work and prayed.
Without, the street boys were singing jeering
songs about her, and not a soul comforted her
with a kind word.</p>

<p>But toward evening there came the whirring of
swans&#8217; wings close by the grating&mdash;it was the
youngest of her brothers. He had found his
sister, and she sobbed aloud with joy, though she
knew that the approaching night would probably
be the last she had to live. But now the work
was almost finished, and her brothers were here.</p>

<p>Now came the archbishop, to stay with her in
her last hour, for he had promised the King to
do so. And she shook her head, and with looks
and gestures she begged him to depart, for in
this night she must finish her work, or else all
would be in vain, all her tears, her pain, and
her sleepless nights. The archbishop withdrew,
uttering evil words against her; but poor Eliza
knew she was innocent, and diligently continued
her work.</p>

<p>The little mice ran about the floor; they
dragged the nettles to her feet, to help as well
as they could; and a thrush sat outside the grating
of the window, and sang to her the whole
night long, as sweetly as possible, to keep up
her courage.</p>

<p>It was still twilight; not till an hour afterward
would the sun rise. And the eleven brothers
stood at the castle gate, and demanded to be
brought before the King. That could not be,
they were told, for it was still almost night; the
King was asleep, and might not be disturbed.
They begged, they threatened, and the sentries
came, yes, even the King himself came out, and
asked what was the meaning of this. At that
moment the sun rose and no more were the
brothers to be seen, but eleven wild swans flew
away over the castle.</p>

<p>All the people came flocking out at the town
gate, for they wanted to see the witch burned.
The old horse drew the cart on which she sat.
They had put upon her a garment of coarse
sackcloth. Her lovely hair hung loose about her
beautiful head; her cheeks were as pale as death;
and her lips moved silently, while her fingers
were engaged with the green flax. Even on the
way to death she did not interrupt the work she
had begun; the ten shirts of mail lay at her feet,
and she wrought at the eleventh. The mob derided
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the red witch, how she mutters! She
has no hymn-book in her hand; no, there she sits
with her ugly sorcery&mdash;tear it in a thousand
pieces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they all pressed upon her, and wanted
to tear up the shirts of mail. Then eleven wild
swans came flying up, and sat round about her
on the cart, and beat with their wings; and the
mob gave way before them, terrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a sign from heaven! She is certainly
innocent!&rdquo; whispered many. But they did not
dare to say it aloud.</p>

<p>Now the executioner seized her by the hand;
then she hastily threw the eleven shirts over the
swans, and immediately eleven handsome Princes
stood there. But the youngest had a swan&#8217;s wing
instead of an arm, for a sleeve was wanting to his
shirt&mdash;she had not quite finished it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I may speak!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am innocent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the people who saw what happened bowed
before her as before a saint; but she sank lifeless
into her brother&#8217;s arms, such an effect had suspense,
anguish, and pain upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, she is innocent,&rdquo; said the eldest
brother.</p>

<p>And now he told everything that had taken
place; and while he spoke a fragrance arose as
of millions of roses, for every piece of faggot in
the pile had taken root and was sending forth
shoots; and a fragrant hedge stood there, tall
and great, covered with red roses, and at the top
a flower, white and shining, gleaming like a star.
This flower the King plucked and placed in Eliza&#8217;s
bosom; and she awoke with peace and happiness
in her heart.</p>

<p>And all the church bells rang of themselves,
and the birds came in great flocks. And back
to the castle such a marriage procession was held
as no King had ever seen.</p>

<h2>TAPER TOM</h2>


<p>In a certain kingdom there was a very beautiful
Princess, but she was so sad that no one could
make her laugh; she would not even smile, though
all in the court were gay and happy.</p>

<p>For a long time her father tried hard to find
something that would amuse her. But she would
sit all day at her window, and, though the members
of the court passed and repassed, and called
out greetings to her, she would only sigh.</p>

<p>So at last her father the King caused it to be
published abroad that whoever should make the
Princess laugh should have her hand in marriage,
and that half of the kingdom would be her
dowry.</p>

<p>But, that none might attempt this difficult feat
without fair assurance, the King added as a sort
of postscript to his decree that whoever tried to
make the Princess laugh and failed should have
two broad red stripes cut in his back, and salt
should be rubbed into the stripes!</p>

<p>Now, as you may imagine, soon there were a
great many sore backs in the kingdom and in the
kingdoms round about. For it was deemed but a
slight matter to make a Princess laugh: did not
women giggle at little and at nothing?</p>

<p>But, although many came, and there were
strange things done, the Princess remained as sad
as before.</p>

<p>Now, there was in the kingdom a farmer who
had three sons, and they decided that each should
have a trial at this task; for to win a dowry of
half a kingdom was well worth trying.</p>

<p>The oldest of the farmer&#8217;s sons was a soldier,
and had served in the wars, where there was
always much laughter. And he said that it would
not be worth while for his two brothers to plan
to journey to the court, because he intended
to win the Princess that very first day.</p>

<p>So he dressed up in his uniform, and put his
knapsack on his back, and strutted up and down
the road in front of the window of the Princess
like any pouter-pigeon. But, though the Princess
looked at him, once, she did not even turn her
eyes in his direction a second time, and the stripes
which were cut in his back were deep and broad,
and he went home feeling very sore.</p>

<p>His next brother was a schoolmaster, and had
one long leg and one short leg, so that when he
stood on the long leg he seemed a very tall man,
and when he stood on the short leg he seemed but
a dwarf, and he had always found that he could
make folk laugh by quickly changing himself
from a tall man to a mere dwarf. Moreover, he
was a preacher, and he came out on the road in
front of the Princess&#8217; window and preached like
seven parsons and chanted like seven clerks; but
it was all for naught, for after the first glance the
Princess did not even look at him, though the
King who stood near had to hold on to the pillars
for laughing.</p>

<p>So the schoolmaster also went home with a very
sore back; and when the third brother, whose
name was Taper Tom, because he sat in the ashes
and made tapers out of fir, said he now would go
and make the Princess laugh, the two older
brothers turned to him in scorn, for how could he
do what neither of them, the soldier and the
schoolmaster, had quite failed to do? The Princess
would not even look at him, he might be
sure.</p>

<p>But Taper Tom said that he would try.</p>

<p>But when he came to the court he did not go
before the King to say that he had come to make
the Princess laugh. Many there were who were
trying that each day, and there was hardly a well
back in all the kingdom by now, and Taper Tom
had no mind to have his own back cut, for they
were cutting the stripes broader and rubbing
the salt in harder every day.</p>

<p>So Taper Tom went to the court and asked for
work to do. They told him that there was no
work to be done, but he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, no work&mdash;even in the kitchen? I am
sure that the cook needs some one to fetch and
carry for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said the lord high chamberlain,
&ldquo;that might perhaps be. You may go to the
kitchen and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Taper Tom went to the kitchen and the
cook gave him work fetching and carrying. And
every day Taper Tom saw the men who came
and went away with their backs sore.</p>

<p>One morning he was sent to the stream to catch
a fish, and he caught a nice, fat one. As he
came back he met a woman leading a goose with
golden feathers by a string tied around its neck.</p>

<p>The old woman wanted a fish, so she asked
Taper Tom if he would trade the fish for the
golden goose. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is a very
strange goose. If you lead it about and anyone
lays hands on it, and you say, &lsquo;Hang on, if you
care to come with us,&rsquo; he will have to hang on and
go with the goose wherever you lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Taper Tom, &ldquo;you may have my
fish and I will take your goose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old woman took the fish, and Taper Tom
took the end of the string in his hand, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
goose followed after.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he met a goody
who looked longingly at the goose with the
golden feathers, and at last she said to Taper
Tom: &ldquo;That is a very fine goose, and I would
like to stroke it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Taper Tom.</p>

<p>So the goody laid her hand on the back of
the goose, and Taper Tom said: &ldquo;Hang on, if
you care to go with us.&rdquo; And the old woman
could not take her hands off the goose, no matter
how hard she tried.</p>

<p>They went on down the road a way and came
to a man who for a long time had hated the
goody, and he laughed loudly to see her hanging
on to the goose and trying so hard to let go; and
thinking to make more difficulty for her he lifted
up his foot and kicked at her.</p>

<p>As his foot touched her dress Taper Tom said:
&ldquo;Hang on, if you care to come with us.&rdquo; And
the man&#8217;s foot hung on to the dress of the goody,
and, try as hard as he would, he could not let go.
He had to follow, hopping on one foot all the
while, and falling often and being dragged. He
was very angry, and said a great many bad words.</p>

<p>As they passed the blacksmith shop the brawny
smith stood at the door, and when he saw Taper
Tom leading the goose, and the goody hanging
on to its back, and the man following, hopping
on one leg, he began to laugh very much, and
ran up to the man and struck him with his
bellows, which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>And as the bellows touched the man, Taper
Tom said: &ldquo;Hang on, if you care to come with
us.&rdquo; And the smith had to follow after the man,
for, try as he would, he could not let go of the
bellows, nor would the bellows let go of the man.</p>

<p>Then Taper Tom turned in on the road that
lay in front of the window of the Princess, and
though he did not look up, he knew that the
Princess was watching.</p>

<p>And when the Princess saw the boy leading
the golden goose, and the goody hanging on to
the back of the goose, and the man hopping on
one leg behind the goody, and the smith hanging
on to his bellows, she smiled inwardly, but she
did not laugh.</p>

<p>Taper Tom did not stop, but went on around
to the kitchen; and when the cook came out to
ask for her fish, with her pot and ladle in her
hand, and she saw the golden goose, and the
goody, and the man, and the smith, she began
to laugh, and laugh, and laugh, so that all the
court came out to see what had happened, and
the Princess leaned from her window to know
what it was all about.</p>

<p>And just then the cook&#8217;s ladle touched the
shoulder of the smith, and at that moment Taper
Tom said: &ldquo;Hang on, if you care to come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned and started back past the window
of the Princess. And when the Princess saw the
cook hanging on to the shoulder of the smith, with
her ladle and her pot in her hand, and trying hard
to get loose, and the smith hanging on with his
bellows to the coat of the man, and the man hanging
on with one foot to the goody, and the goody
with her hands on the back of the golden goose,
and the golden goose following Taper Tom, led
by a string, she began to laugh and to laugh and
to laugh.</p>

<p>Then the King proclaimed that Taper Tom
should wed the Princess, and that half the kingdom
would be her dowry.</p>

<h2><a name="NORTH" id="NORTH"></a>THE BOY WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Go you now to the safe and get some meal,&rdquo;
said the mother of the Boy. &ldquo;And mind that you
carry it carefully, for there is but little left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Boy went to the safe to get the meal,
but as he came back with it the North Wind blew
it away, and he went home empty-handed, and
there was no meal in the house that day.</p>

<p>The next morning the mother sent the Boy
to the safe again, and once more the North Wind
came and took the meal.</p>

<p>On the third day it was as before. Then the
Boy said: &ldquo;I will go to the North Wind and
demand that he give back my meal, for we have
nothing to eat in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boy started and went far, far to the
country where the North Wind abode; and when
he had come there the North Wind said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you greeting and thanks for your coming.
What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Boy answered: &ldquo;I give you back your
greeting, and I am come for the meal which
you have taken away from me, for we have none
left in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he told how for three days the North
Wind had come and taken the meal as he returned
with it from the safe, and now there was
nothing to eat in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not got your meal,&rdquo; said the North
Wind, &ldquo;but I will give you a magic cloth which,
whenever you say to it, &lsquo;Cloth, serve forth a
dinner,&rsquo; will provide you with all that you can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
eat and drink in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boy took the cloth and started for his
home, but as he had a long way to go he stopped
over night at an inn, and, being hungry, and
wanting to test the cloth, he sat down at a table
and unfolded it before him, saying: &ldquo;Cloth,
serve forth a dinner.&rdquo; Immediately there was
served upon the cloth all sorts of good things
to eat&mdash;such food as the Boy had never eaten
before in his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a magic cloth,&rdquo; said the Boy,
when, the dinner eaten, he folded the cloth carefully
and put it under his pillow before he slept.</p>

<p>Now, the inn-keeper had been a witness to the
thing which had happened, and had heard the
words which the Boy said to the cloth, so
he decided that he must possess so wonderful a
thing as that, for it would save him much labor.
Accordingly, after the Boy had gone to sleep, he
stole quietly into the room and slipped the wallet
from under the Boy&#8217;s pillow and put into it a
cloth of his own exactly like it.</p>

<p>When the Boy reached home the next day his
mother asked him if he had been to the North
Wind, and if he had brought back the meal.</p>

<p>The Boy said: &ldquo;The North Wind was glad to
see me, and thanked me for coming, but said he
did not have the meal. Instead, he gave me a
magic cloth, so that we need never be hungry
again, for it will serve us a dinner at any time
we bid it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took the cloth from his wallet and unfolded
it on the table, as he had done at the inn,
and said: &ldquo;Cloth, serve forth a dinner.&rdquo; But,
as it was not a magic cloth, nothing happened.</p>

<p>Then the Boy said that he would go again to
the North Wind and tell him that his cloth would
not do as it was bidden. So he journeyed far
to the home of the North Wind, and the North
Wind said: &ldquo;I give you greeting and thanks
for your coming. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the boy told him how he had come before
to ask him for the meal which the North Wind
had taken, and the North Wind had given him
a magic cloth which should serve forth a dinner
when it was bidden; but that, though at the inn
the cloth had served forth a dinner, when he
reached his home it had not done so, and there
was nothing to eat in the house.</p>

<p>Then said the North Wind: &ldquo;I have no meal to
give you, but I will give you a ram which, whenever
you say to it, &lsquo;Ram, Ram, coin money,&rsquo; will
coin gold ducats before you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Boy took the ram and started for home;
but as it was a long way he stopped at the same
inn on his way home, and being anxious to try the
skill of the ram, and needing to pay his bill to
the inn-keeper he said to it: &ldquo;Ram, Ram, coin
money.&rdquo; And the ram coined golden ducats until
the Boy told it to stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought the observing inn-keeper, &ldquo;this
is a famous ram indeed. I must have this ram,
and I will not need to work at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when the Boy had gone to bed, leaving the
ram safely tied in his room, the inn-keeper slipped
in quietly, leading another ram which could not
coin ducats, which he left in place of the ram
which the North Wind had given to the Boy.</p>

<p>And when the Boy reached home his mother
asked him if he had brought back the meal this
time. And the Boy answered: &ldquo;The North Wind
was glad to see me, and thanked me for coming,
but he said that he did not have the meal. But
he gave me a ram, which, when I bid it, &lsquo;Ram,
Ram, coin money,&rsquo; coins golden ducats, so that
we will not be hungry any more, for we can buy
what we need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he led forth the ram into the room and
said to it: &ldquo;Ram, Ram, coin money.&rdquo; And the
ram, not being a magic ram, did nothing but stand
in the middle of the room and stare at him.</p>

<p>Now the Boy was angry, and he said: &ldquo;I will
go to the North Wind and tell him that his ram
is worth nothing, and that I want my rights for
the meal which he has taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So back he went to the North Wind, and when
he had told his story the North Wind said: &ldquo;I
have nothing that I can give you but that old
stick in the bag yonder. But when you say to it,
&lsquo;Stick, come forth and lay on,&rsquo; it lays on unceasingly
until you say to it, &lsquo;Stick, stop.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Boy took the bag with the stick right
willingly, for he had by this time a fair idea of
the cause of his trouble; and he stopped that night
at the inn as he had done before. Though he did
not call forth his magic stick, the inn-keeper
knew by the way in which he cared for his bag
that he had some special treasure, and decided
that the Boy was a simple fellow, and that he
must have this too, whatever it was in the bag.</p>

<p>So when the Boy had gone to his room the man
slipped in quietly and reached his hand under the
Boy&#8217;s pillow, where the bag lay. But the Boy
had not gone to sleep this time, and when he
felt the hand under his pillow he said, &ldquo;Stick,
come forth and lay on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the stick came forth and began to lay on
about the inn-keeper&#8217;s head, and so hard did it
strike that the inn-keeper soon besought the Boy
to bid it stop&mdash;for the stick would respond only
to the owner. But the Boy would not bid the
stick to stop until the inn-keeper had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
roundly punished for his stealings, and had promised
to return the magic cloth and the magic ram.
When he had these again in his possession the
Boy bade the stick return to the bag, and the
next morning he went on to his home.</p>

<p>And when he had laid the cloth on the table
and said to it, &ldquo;Cloth, serve forth a dinner,&rdquo; and
the cloth had served forth a dinner, and he and
his mother had eaten; and he had said to the ram,
&ldquo;Ram, Ram, coin money,&rdquo; and the ram had
coined golden ducats until he bade it to stop;
and he had put the stick in a safe place where
it could always do his bidding, he and his mother
had plenty, and were well paid for the meal
which the North Wind had taken.</p>

<h2><a name="IRON" id="IRON"></a>THE WONDERFUL IRON POT</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a little boy and his mother
lived together in a small brown house at the foot
of a hill. They were very poor, for the boy&#8217;s
father was dead, and the rich man who lived at
the top of the hill had taken everything that they
had, except one cow.</p>

<p>At last it came that there was nothing in the
house to eat, and the mother said: &ldquo;Now we will
have to sell the cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she told the little boy to take the cow to
town and sell it, and the boy put a rope around
the cow&#8217;s neck and started off down the road.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before he met a man with
a cloak over him and carrying something under it.
He asked the little boy where he was going, and
the boy told him that there was nothing to eat
in the house and he was trying to sell the cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sell her to me?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you give me for her?&rdquo; asked the
little boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you an iron pot,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>Now, the little boy knew that he ought not to
sell the cow for an iron pot, and he quickly said
he would not, but as he spoke he heard a tiny
voice under the man&#8217;s cloak saying: &ldquo;Buy me!
Buy me!&rdquo; So he told the stranger that he might
have the cow.</p>

<p>The man took the rope in his hands, and gave
the little boy the iron pot, and he took it
and went home again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you get for the cow?&rdquo; asked
his mother.</p>

<p>By this time the boy was very much ashamed
of having sold the cow for an iron pot, and he
hung his head when his mother asked him what
he had gotten. They were about to throw the
pot away, for, as the mother said, there was
nothing to cook in it, when they heard a tiny
voice say: &ldquo;Put me over the fire and put in
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the mother put the little pot over the fire
and put in water, which, indeed, was all that she
had to put in. And soon the water in the pot
began to bubble and to boil, and the little pot
said: &ldquo;I skip! I skip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far do you skip, little Pot?&rdquo; asked the
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I skip to the house of the rich man at the
top of the hill,&rdquo; said the pot.</p>

<p>And the little pot began to skip, skip, first on
one of its three legs and then on another, skippity
skip, skippity skip, until it came to the house
of the rich man at the top of the hill, and it
skipped right into the kitchen of the rich man&#8217;s
house where his wife was making a pudding. All
at once she looked up and saw the little iron pot
on the table, where it had skipped in at the window,
and right in front of her, and she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, where did you come from, little Pot? You
are just what I want to put my pudding in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she put the pudding into the little iron pot,
and as soon as the pudding was in and safely
covered up, the little pot began to skip, skip, first
on one of its three legs and then on another,
skippity skip, skippity skip, down the hill, and
though the farmer&#8217;s wife ran after, she could not
catch it, and away it went straight to the little
brown house at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>So the little boy and his mother had pudding to
eat for dinner.</p>

<p>The next morning the little pot begged to be
put on the fire, and as soon as the water began
to bubble and to boil, it called, &ldquo;I skip! I skip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far do you skip, little Pot?&rdquo; asked the
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I skip to the barn of the rich man at the top
of the hill,&rdquo; said the little pot.</p>

<p>And the little pot began to skip, skip, first on
one of its three legs and then on another, skippity
skip, skippity skip, until it came to the barn of
the rich man at the top of the hill. And in the
barn the thrashers were thrashing the wheat, and
the little pot skipped right out on the thrashing
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;Where did you
come from, little Pot? You are just the thing
to hold some of this wheat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man began pouring the wheat into the
pot, and poured and poured until the little pot
seemed quite full, but still there was room, so the
man poured until all the wheat was in the pot.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Then the little pot began to skip, skip, first on
one of its three legs and then on another, skippity
skip, skippity skip, out of the barn and out on the
road. And though all of the men ran after it they
could not catch it, and it skipped down the hill to
the little brown house.</p>

<p>So the little boy and his mother had plenty of
white bread to eat.</p>

<p>The next morning the little pot begged to be
put on the fire, and as soon as the water began
to bubble and to boil it began to skip, skip, skippity
skip, skippity skip, until it came to the bank
of the rich man, and it skipped right into the
window where the rich man sat with all his
money spread out on his desk. And as he counted
he looked up and saw the little iron pot standing
in front of him, and he said, &ldquo;Where did you
come from, little Pot? You are just the thing
for me to put my money into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began to pile his money into the iron
pot, and though it was soon full there was yet
more room, and he piled more and more, until
at last all his money was in the iron pot. Then
the little pot began to skip, skip, skippity skip,
skippity skip, right out of the bank and down the
street and straight on till it came to the little
brown house at the bottom of the hill. And
though the rich man ran after it he could not
catch it, and so all the money that he had taken
from the little boy and his mother was carried
back to them in the little iron pot.</p>

<p>The next morning the little pot begged to be
put on the fire again, and the mother said: &ldquo;Why
should you be put on the fire, little Pot? Have
we not everything that we want?&rdquo; But the little
pot still wanted to be put on the fire; and at last,
when the mother had put in the water and made
the fire, and the water began to bubble and to boil,
the little pot said: &ldquo;I skip! I skip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the mother said: &ldquo;How far do you skip,
little Pot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I skip to the end of the world,&rdquo; said the little
pot. And it began to skip, skip, first on one of its
three legs and then on another, skippity skip,
skippity skip, until it came to the top of the
hill, and there was the rich man hunting for his
money. And when he saw the little iron pot he
cried out: &ldquo;There is the pot that stole my
money!&rdquo; And he caught up with the pot and
put his hand into it to take out his money, but
his hand could not find the money; so he put his
head in to look for it, and he could not see it;
next he climbed into the pot, and then it began to
skip, skip, far away up the hill and up the mountain,
and away to the end of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="SHEEP" id="SHEEP"></a>THE SHEEP AND PIG WHO SET UP HOUSEKEEPING</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a Sheep stood in a pen to be
fattened for the winter&#8217;s feast. He lived well,
for he was given the best of everything, and he
soon became so fat that one day the maid who
came to bring his food said: &ldquo;Eat full to-day,
little Sheep, for to-morrow will come the killing
and we shall eat you.&rdquo; And she shut the gate
and went away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Sheep, &ldquo;I have heard that,
Women&#8217;s words are worth heeding, and that, There
is a cure and a physic for everything except
death. There being no cure for that, it is best
to find a way out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he ate up all the food that the maid had
left for him, and then he butted hard against the
gate of the pen, and it flew open, and the Sheep
went out of the pen and out on the big road.</p>

<p>He followed the road to a neighboring farm,
and made his way to a pigsty where was fastened
a Pig that he had known on the common.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, and thanks for our last merry meeting!&rdquo;
said the Sheep. &ldquo;Do you know why you
are fed so well while you stay in this sty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that I do not,&rdquo; said the Pig. &ldquo;But I am
very glad to get the good food and plenty of it,
which they have been bringing to me since I was
shut up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, there is reason for that,&rdquo; said the Sheep.
&ldquo;Many a flask empties the cask. They want to
make you very fat, for their purpose is to eat you
at the winter&#8217;s feasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May they not forget to say grace after meat,&rdquo;
said the Pig. &ldquo;I can do naught to hinder their
eating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will do as I do we will go off together
into the woods and build a house and set up
housekeeping,&rdquo; said the Sheep. &ldquo;A home is a
home, be it ever so homely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Sheep and the Pig together butted down
the pigsty, and started off on the big road together.
&ldquo;Good company is good comfort,&rdquo; said
the Pig, as they trotted along.</p>

<p>As they entered the big woods they met a
Goose, who had come out on the common.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, and thanks for our last merry
meeting,&rdquo; said the Goose, &ldquo;where are you going
so fast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know that we were too well off at
home, and so we have set off into the woods to
build a house and set up housekeeping,&rdquo; said the
Sheep, &ldquo;for, Every man&#8217;s house is his castle, if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
build it but big and strong enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said the Goose, &ldquo;all places are
alike to me, but I should like to build a house; so
if you like I will go with you, for, It&#8217;s but child&#8217;s
play when three share the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With gossip and gabble is built neither house
nor stable!&rdquo; said the Pig. &ldquo;What can you do to
help build the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By cunning and skill a cripple can do what he
will,&rdquo; said the Goose. &ldquo;I can gather moss to put
into the crevices and cracks, and so make the
house warm and comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Piggy wanted above everything else to
be warm and comfortable, so he said that the
Goose might come along.</p>

<p>As the three journeyed on they met a Hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, and thanks for our last merry meeting,&rdquo;
said the Hare; &ldquo;where are you hurrying to
so fast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Sheep explained how they were too
well off at home, and were going into the woods
to build a house and set up housekeeping, &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;You may travel the world around, but
there is no place like home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Hare, &ldquo;for the matter of that, I
have a home in every bush. But I have always
thought that some day I would build a house,
and I will go with you if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could use you to scare away the dogs,&rdquo;
said the Pig, &ldquo;but you would be no good for
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who lives long enough will always find
work to do,&rdquo; said the Hare. &ldquo;I have sharp teeth
to gnaw the boards, and paws to hammer them
fast. I can set up at any time for a carpenter,
for, Good tools make good work, as the man said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he got leave to go, and there was no more
said about it.</p>

<p>As they went deeper into the woods they met
a Cock, who gave them greeting and asked where
they were going.</p>

<p>Then the Sheep explained how they were too
well off at home, and were going into the woods
to build a house and set up housekeeping, &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
said the Sheep, &ldquo;He who out of doors shall bake,
loses at last both coal and cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Cock, &ldquo;that is just my case,
for, It&#8217;s far better to sit on one&#8217;s own perch, for
then one can never be left in the lurch; besides,
All cocks crow loudest at home. If I may have
your leave, I will come with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Pig protested. &ldquo;Flapping and crowing
sets tongues a-going!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;but, A jaw
on a stick never yet laid a brick. How can you
help us or make yourself useful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Cock, &ldquo;That house will never
have a clock where there is neither dog nor cock.
I will wake you up every morning, and will cry
the alarm when the dawn arises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the Pig, who was very like
to oversleep. &ldquo;Sleep is a greedy thief, and thinks
nothing of robbing you of half your life. You
may come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they all set off together into the woods, and
at last they came to a good place and built the
house. The Pig hewed the timber, and the Sheep
drew it home; the Hare was the carpenter, and
the Goose gathered moss and filled all of the
cracks and crevices, and the Cock wakened them
every morning early.</p>

<p>At last the house was done, and it was snug,
and warm, and comfortable. &ldquo;&#8217;Tis good to travel
east and west, but, after all, a home is best,&rdquo; said
the Sheep.</p>

<p>And they lived together until cold weather came,
when they put up a stove to keep warm, and they
planned to enjoy the long winter.</p>

<p>Now, not far off from the house lived the
Wolf and his family, and his brother and his
brother&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>And the Wolf and his brother saw the house
which the Sheep and the Pig and the Goose and
the Hare and the Cock had builded, and they
talked together of how warm and comfortable
it was, and the Wolf decided that they must get
acquainted with their new neighbors.</p>

<p>So he made up an errand and went to the door
and said he had come to ask for a light to his
pipe; and while the door was held open he pushed
himself inside.</p>

<p>Then all at once he found himself in a great
confusion, for the Sheep butted him so hard that
he fell against the stove; and the Pig gored and
bit him; and the Goose nipped and pecked him;
and the Hare ran about over the house, now on
the floor and now aloft, so that the Wolf did not
know who or what he was, and was scared out
of his wits, and all the time the Cock perched
on a top beam and flapped his wings and crowed
and crowed.</p>

<p>By-and-by the Wolf managed to get near the
door and to dash through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neighborhood makes for brotherhood,&rdquo; said the
Wolf&#8217;s brother. &ldquo;You must have made good
friends, since you remained so long. But what
became of your errand, for you have neither
pipe nor smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice life makes pleasant company,&rdquo; said the
Wolf. &ldquo;Such manners I never saw. For no
sooner was I inside than the shoemaker flew at
me with his last, and two smiths blew bellows and
made the sparks fly, and beat and punched me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
with red-hot pincers, and tore great pieces out of
my body, the hunter kept running about trying
to find his gun, and it is well for me that he did
not, for I should never have come out alive; and
all the while a butcher sat up on a beam and
flapped his arms and sang out to the others:
&lsquo;Put a hook into him! Put a hook into him
and drag him thither!&rsquo; so it was all I could do to
get out alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his brother, &ldquo;we can&#8217;t choose in
this wicked world, and an unbidden guest sometimes
gets bad treatment. But I think that we
will be very well advised to let these new neighbors
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Wolf, and the Wolf&#8217;s family, and the
Wolf&#8217;s brother and his brother&#8217;s family, let the
Sheep and the Pig and the Goose and the Hare
and the Cock alone, and they lived very happily
in their house in the woods.</p>

<h2><a name="GRASS" id="GRASS"></a>DOLL-IN-THE-GRASS</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had
twelve sons. These sons did not like to do useful
things&mdash;they only liked to ride and to hunt in
the woods, and to do what pleased them.</p>

<p>One day the King said: &ldquo;You shall each one
go forth into the world to seek a bride. But you
must choose a bride who can do useful things&mdash;and,
to prove it, she must be able to gather the
flax and spin and weave a shirt all in one day.
If she cannot do this, I will not accept her as
my daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the sons set out on their errands, each riding
a beautiful horse, and looking forward to having
a great time out in the world while he hunted
for his bride.</p>

<p>But the youngest son, Boots, was not popular
with the others. So they said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boots shall not go with us. We will not have
him along&mdash;he will not do the things that we want
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Boots drew rein on his horse, and the
others rode out of sight.</p>

<p>Now, Boots was very unhappy when he was
left alone in the woods, and he got off his horse
and sat down on a log to think. For he did not
know where to go to have the good times that
his brothers had been talking about, and he did
not know where to seek a bride.</p>

<p>As he sat thinking, he heard a strange sound
near him&mdash;a sound like silver bells tinkling softly;
or was it fairies laughing? Boots looked all
about him, but could see nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; exclaimed a sweet little voice.
And Boots looked down at the grass at his feet,
and there was the tiniest little creature smiling up
at him, swaying with the stem of a flower which
waved in the slight breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sad?&rdquo; asked this tiny maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;my father has sent me and
my brothers forth into the world to find brides,
and my brothers have gone on and left me all
alone in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little creature laughed right merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose they have!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The
wood is the most beautiful place in the world!
And as for brides&mdash;you can find them there if
you but seek for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Boots was down in the soft grass
beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my bride must be able to gather the flax,
and spin and weave a shirt, all in one day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauf!&rdquo; exclaimed the little creature, &ldquo;that is
no great task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she tapped a tiny wand twice on the
flower stem, and a spinning-wheel stood before
her&mdash;such a tiny little spinning wheel! She
lifted the wand again, and the flax stem bent
down, so that she gathered its flower, and in a
minute the spinning-wheel was twirling merrily.
A touch of the wand, and the loom was before
her; then the thread was spun into white cloth as
fine as cobweb. Boots watched, fascinated. The
little creature next fashioned the cloth into a shirt&mdash;such
a tiny shirt&mdash;and never was one so fine
seen in all the world before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall come with me to the palace&mdash;you
shall be my bride!&rdquo; exclaimed Boots.</p>

<p>The little creature smiled at him, and said: &ldquo;I
will go with you to the palace, and I will be your
bride, but I must go in my own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go in any way that you will!&rdquo; said
Boots.</p>

<p>So Doll-in-the-Grass touched the stem of the
flower again, and her own silver carriage came to
her, drawn by two tiny white mice. And Boots
rode beside her, careful that his great horse
should not crush the little carriage.</p>

<p>The little mice traveled very fast, and it was
not long before they came to a stream. Now,
the great horse could swim the stream without
difficulty; but when the mice plunged into it little
Doll-in-the-Grass and the silver carriage and all
went under the water. Then Boots was disconsolate,
but as he stood, mourning, a beautiful
maiden came up out of the water, a maiden fairer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
than any in all the kingdom, and neither smaller
nor larger than any of them. And she smiled
at Boots and said: &ldquo;You see how love can do
great things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Boots caught her up on his horse before
him and exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, love can indeed do
great things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they rode home together. And of all
the wives whom his brothers won, none was so
beautiful as Doll-in-the-Grass. And of all the
shirts that the wives spun, none was so fine or so
soft as the one which Doll-in-the-Grass gave to
her father-in-law; and it had become a big shirt&mdash;large
enough for a man to wear&mdash;and was as
soft as silk and as fine as any cobweb could
possibly be.</p>

<p>And the King loved her more than any of his
other daughters-in-law, and Boots more than any
of his other sons; so he said they should live with
him in his palace, and by-and-by succeed him on
the throne.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BROTHERS" id="BROTHERS"></a>BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had
seven sons. One day he said to the six older
ones: &ldquo;You must go forth into the world, each
one, and seek a bride. But Boots is too young
to go, so he shall stay at home. And when you
have found brides for yourselves, each one, you
shall seek the fairest Princess in all the seven
kingdoms, and bring her home with you, and she
shall be a bride for Boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the six sons set out, and each found a
bride, all so lovely that it was not possible to
say which was the most beautiful. But the brothers
were so interested, each one, in his own
bride, that all forgot they were to seek a bride
for Boots, and they started home again.</p>

<p>One night on the way they were forced by
a storm to seek shelter in the castle of a Giant,
and the next morning while they were standing
in the front of the castle, with their retainers
about them and their horses saddled ready to
mount and depart, the Giant suddenly turned them
all into stone where they stood&mdash;the brothers into
large stone pillars, the brides into smaller pillars,
the retainers into small stones, and the horses
into stone horses. And there all stood in front of
the castle, and the Giant went away laughing.</p>

<p>After a long time of waiting at home, one day
the King said to his youngest son: &ldquo;It must be
that your brothers are dead. My heart is broken,
and had I not you, my son, to console me in my
old age, I should die of sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my father,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;for long I have
been thinking that I must go forth into the world
and find my brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;for evil has
certainly befallen them, and the same evil may
befall you, and I shall be left alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;whatever evil has befallen
them I must fare forth and find out; and I will
come back to you and bring my brothers with me,
that will I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So at last the King yielded, and Boots set out.
But there were no retainers to go with him, and
his father had only an old, broken-down horse
to give him, for the other brothers had taken all
the fine horses from the stables, for their own
riding, and to bring back their brides upon. But
Boots set forth right merrily on the old horse,
often stopping to let him rest, for he could not
go fast, as could a younger steed.</p>

<p>As they journeyed through the woods a Raven
fell almost at the horse&#8217;s feet, and Boots pulled
him back quickly, that the bird might not be
stamped upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, good master,&rdquo; said the Raven.
&ldquo;I am so hungry that I was faint, and fell from
the tree. Will you give me something to eat, and
I will serve you faithfully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;I see not how you
can serve me, and I have but scant food. But
if you are so hungry that you fell from a tree,
you must need food badly, so I will give you a
share of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Boots gave the Raven some food, and went
on through the forest. At last he came to a
stream, and saw a Salmon swimming feebly about
near the shore. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the Salmon, as Boots
stopped to give his horse a drink, &ldquo;will you give
me food? I am so hungry that I can scarce
swim about in the stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;everybody seems to be hungry
to-day, and for the matter of that, so am I. And
how can you serve me, I would like to know?
Nevertheless, since you are so hungry I will give
you food, for it is not pleasant to be hungry, as
I well know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he gave the Salmon some of his food, and
went on through the forest.</p>

<p>By-and-by he came to a Wolf, looking so gaunt
and lean that he was almost afraid to pass by
where the animal stood. But the Wolf stopped
him and said: &ldquo;Will you give me something to
eat? I am so hungry that I can scarce follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
a trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;this is getting a little
thick. First a Raven, and then a Salmon, and
now a Wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;but there is little
food in the forest. Nevertheless, with but a morsel
I could follow the trail, and find plenty, and
I would serve you at any time that I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now have I many servants,&rdquo; laughed Boots&mdash;&ldquo;a
Raven, and a Salmon, and a Wolf. I will give
you food, however, for you look as if you needed
it sorely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he gave the Wolf food, and when he had
eaten, the Wolf said: &ldquo;Do you follow the trail
which I make, and I will lead you where you
would go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boots laughed merrily, for since he did not
know which way to go himself it hardly seemed
as if the Wolf could lead him in that way.
Nevertheless, since all ways were alike, he
thought, he might as well follow the Wolf, so
he turned his horse&#8217;s head in that direction.</p>

<p>The Wolf trotted along before, and at last he
turned and said: &ldquo;This is the Giant&#8217;s castle, and
the pillars yonder are your brothers and their
wives which the Giant has turned to stone. It is
for you to go into the castle and find a way to set
them free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;but how will I prevent
the Giant&#8217;s making a stone pillar out of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Climb up on my back,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;and
I will take you into the castle, but once there
you must look out for yourself. But if you need
me, whistle, and I will be beside you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I,&rdquo; said Boots, &ldquo;and you, mind that
you are not far, for I think I shall need you
right speedily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Wolf trotted out and left Boots standing
in the hall of the castle. And Boots turned about
and looked toward the inner room, and there
he saw a Princess which he knew at once was
the fairest Princess in all the seven kingdoms;
and he said to himself: &ldquo;When I have set my
brothers free I shall not need to seek far for
my own bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess greeted him, and told him that
it was true that the Giant had turned his brothers,
and their brides, and their retainers into stone,
and that he would turn them back again, one by
one, when he wanted to eat them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will he do with me?&rdquo; exclaimed
Boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hide under the bed there,&rdquo; said the
Princess, &ldquo;and I will take care of you. For you
must know that no matter how brave and strong
you may be you cannot kill this Giant, for he
does not keep his heart in his body. It is hidden
away somewhere, for he is afraid that some one
will kill him, so he keeps it no one knows where.
But to-night I will ask him where it is, and do
you listen, and it may be that we can find it and
kill him, and you can set your brothers and their
brides and me free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I,&rdquo; said Boots, looking at her with
eyes that told what he would do when he had set
them all free.</p>

<p>So at last the Giant came home, and after he
had eaten and was feeling very good-natured, the
Princess said to him: &ldquo;I have always wondered
where it is that you keep your heart, for it is
evident that it is not in your body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and it is not,&rdquo; said the Giant, &ldquo;for if
it were I should have been dead long ago. But
I will tell you where it is&mdash;it is under the great
doorstep at the entrance of the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, after the Giant had gone
out, Boots and the Princess dug and tugged, and
tugged and dug, until at last they lifted the great
doorstep at the entrance of the castle. But there
was no heart under it. Then the Princess piled
flowers about, that it might not show where she
had been digging, and when the Giant came back
he laughed loudly, and said: &ldquo;What sort of
nonsense is this? You thought my heart was
there, you silly, and have piled flowers about it.
But my heart is not there. It is in the back of
the big cupboard in the deepest dungeon keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day after the Giant had gone Boots
and the Princess went down to the deepest dungeon
keep, and they dug and tugged, and tugged
and dug, until at last they had moved the cupboard
from the wall; but there was no heart there.
So the Princess piled flowers about, as she had
done before. That night when the Giant came
home he went down into the dungeon and saw
the flowers, and said: &ldquo;You did, indeed, wish
to pay honor to my heart, you foolish child, but
it is not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then tears stood in the beautiful eyes of the
Princess, and she said: &ldquo;Oh, then, tell me where
it is, that I may place flowers about the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not possible,&rdquo; said the Giant, &ldquo;for it
is too far away from here, and you could not get
to it. On a great hill in the forest stands a
church, and in the church is a well, and in the
well there is a duck, swimming backward and
forward on the water; and in the duck is an egg,
and in the egg is my heart; so you had best give
up your foolish notion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boots, under the bed, heard every word; and
the next morning, after the Giant had set out, he,
too, started, whistling to the Wolf, who came at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
once. Boots told him that he wished to go to the
church that stood on the high hill in the forest;
and the Wolf said: &ldquo;I know just where the place
is. Jump on my back, and we will be there in no
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Boots jumped upon the Wolf&#8217;s back, and
they set off through the forest, and soon came to
the church on the high hill. But the great doors
were locked, and it was not possible for Boots to
break them down, though he tried hard enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;we must call the
Raven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they called the Raven, and he came and
flew up over the top of the church, and into the
belfry, and down into the porter&#8217;s room, and
caught up the keys of the church, and in a moment
he was back with them. Then Boots opened
the doors and he and the Wolf and the Raven
entered; and in the church they found a well,
as the Giant had said, and on the water in the
well there was a duck swimming backward and
forward. Then Boots caught up the duck in his
hands, and thought that now he had the Giant&#8217;s
heart, when suddenly the duck let the egg drop
into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Wolf, &ldquo;we must call the Salmon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they called the Salmon, and he swam down
into the water and brought up the egg in his
mouth, and Boots caught up the egg in his hand
and squeezed it hard, and at once the Giant far
off in the forest cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Squeeze it harder,&rdquo; cried the Salmon, &ldquo;and I
shall be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Giant far off in the woods begged hard
for his life, and the Wolf said: &ldquo;Tell him that
if he would have you spare his life he must at
once set free your brothers and their brides and
their retainers,&rdquo; said the Wolf.</p>

<p>So Boots cried aloud this message to the Giant,
squeezing the heart which he held in his hand as
he did so; and the Giant called to him from far
off in the forest that he had already done this,
even as Boots had asked him, and now would
he please let his heart sink back into the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Raven, &ldquo;squeeze it but a little
harder, and I shall be free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Boots squeezed the heart harder and harder,
until at last it was squeezed quite in two, and
what was his surprise to see standing beside him
two young Princes, fair, almost, as the fair Princess
in the Giant&#8217;s castle, who Boots knew was
the most beautiful in all the seven kingdoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hasten back to the castle, now,&rdquo; said
the Wolf, &ldquo;that we may tell the Princes and their
brides and the Princess in the castle that the
Giant is dead, and they have nothing more to
fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Wolf lifted up his voice and howled,
and at once two other wolves stood beside them.
&ldquo;Climb up, each one of you,&rdquo; said the first Wolf,
&ldquo;and we will be back at the castle in no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Boots and the two Princes climbed up each
on the back of a wolf, and they were soon back
at the castle; and Boots found his brothers, and
their fair brides, and the Princess waiting for
them. Then they all set out for the kingdom of
their father, who was very glad to see them, to
be sure. And Boots said: &ldquo;I have brought back
your sons to you, but I have brought back the
fairest Princess in the seven kingdoms to be my
own bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the brides of the other Princes were
very fair, yet all agreed that the bride of Boots
was the most beautiful of all.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Translated by Mrs. Gudrun Thorne-Thompson</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE DOLL UNDER THE BRIER ROSEBUSH</strong></p>


<p>There was once a girl, and her name was
Beate. On her birthday her father had given
her a beautiful straw hat. Her mother had given
her a pair of yellow shoes and the daintiest white
dress. But her old aunt had given her the very
best present of all; it was a doll, with a sweet
face and dark brown curls.</p>

<p>Oh, how Beate grew to love that doll, almost
more than she loved Marie and Louise, and they
were her best friends.</p>

<p>One day Beate was walking in the yard with
her doll in her arms. It had a name now, and
they had become fast friends. She had called her
Beate, her own name, and the name of her old
aunt who had given her the present.</p>

<p>It was in the early Spring. There was a green
spot in one corner of the yard around the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
well. There stood a big willow tree with a low
trunk, and it was covered with the little yellow
blossoms that children call &ldquo;goslings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They look like goslings, too, for each little
tassel has soft yellow down, and they can swim
in the water.</p>

<p>Now, Big Beate and Little Beate soon agreed
that they would pick goslings from the tree and
throw them into the well, so that these might
have just as good a time as the big geese and
goslings that were swimming about in the pond.
It was really Big Beate who thought of this first,
but Little Beate agreed immediately; you can&#8217;t
imagine how good she always was.</p>

<p>Now, Big Beate climbed up into the willow and
picked many pretty yellow goslings into her little
white apron, and when she counted them she said
that now they had enough, and Little Beate
thought so too.</p>

<p>Both of them ran over to the well, and Big
Beate helped her little friend to get her legs
firmly fixed between the logs that were around the
well, so that she might sit in comfort and watch
the little goslings swim about on the water.
Then gosling after gosling was dropped down,
and as soon as each one reached the water it
seemed to become alive and it moved about. Oh,
what fun!</p>

<p>But after awhile the little goslings would not
swim any longer, but lay quite still. That was
no fun at all, so Big Beate asked her namesake
if she didn&#8217;t think she might lean a little over
the edge of the well and blow on them, for then
she thought they might come to life again. Little
Beate didn&#8217;t answer, but she raised her left eye-brow,
saying, &ldquo;Please don&#8217;t do that, dear Big
Beate! Don&#8217;t you remember, Mother has told us
how dark it is down there in the well? Think,
if you should fall in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense; just see how easy it is,&rdquo; said
Big Beate. She leaned out over the wall and blew
on the nearest ones. Yes, it helped&mdash;the goslings
began to swim again. But those that were farthest
away didn&#8217;t move at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What stupid little things!&rdquo; said Beate; and
she leaned far, far out over the edge of the well.
Then her little hands slipped on the smooth log&mdash;splash!
Down she fell into the water. It was
so cold, so icy cold, and it closed over her head,
and took the straw hat, which she had got on
her birthday, off her hair! She hadn&#8217;t time to
hear whether Little Beate screamed, but I&#8217;m
sure she did.</p>

<p>When Beate&#8217;s head came up over the water
again she grasped the round log with both her
hands, but the hands were too small, and the log
too wide and slippery, she couldn&#8217;t hold on. Then
she saw her dear friend, Little Beate, standing
stiff and dumb with fright, staring at her and
with her right arm stretched out to her. Big
Beate hurriedly caught hold of her and Little
Beate made herself as stiff as she could, and stiffer
still, and stood there between the logs holding her
dear friend out of the water.</p>

<p>Now Beate screamed so loudly that her father
and mother heard her and came running as fast
as they could, pale and frightened, and pulled her
out. She was dripping wet, and so scared and
cold that her teeth chattered.</p>

<p>Now they put Beate to bed, and Little Beate
had to sleep with her. When she had said her
prayers she hugged her little friend and said:
&ldquo;Never, never can I thank you enough, because
you saved me from that horrible deep well, dear
Little Beate. You shall be my very best friend,
always, and when I grow up you shall be the
godmother to my first daughter, and I shall call
her Little Beate for you.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE FLOATING ISLAND</strong></p>

<p>Beate was now a year older. During that year
she had lost Little Beate, but she had never forgotten
her.</p>

<p>Big Beate had many dolls given to her, but not
one was like Little Beate. No one was so sweet
and good-natured, no one so pretty and graceful.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday, and the next day, Sunday,
she expected her friends, Marie and Louise, on
a visit, for it was her birthday; therefore she
wanted to decorate her doll-house as prettily as
she could.</p>

<p>Beate knew what to do. On the hillside by
the Black Pond she remembered that she had seen
the prettiest little snail shells anyone might wish
for&mdash;round and fluted, with yellow and brown
markings. They would be just the thing for her
bureau. She ran off to search for them, slipping
in and out through the hazel bushes, and picking
empty shells by the dozen.</p>

<p>But all of a sudden she heard a bird utter such
a weird cry from the lake. She peeped out between
the green branches and saw a big bird
swimming about. It had a long blue neck and a
white breast, but its back was shining black. It
swam fast, and then suddenly dived and was gone.</p>

<p>Beate stood there and stared at the water, hoping
to see the bird come up again, but she waited
and waited in vain. She was frightened, thinking
it was drowned, when she saw it shoot up again
far away, almost in the middle of the lake. Then
it began to swim slowly toward a tiny green
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
island which lay there, and crept into the high
weeds and grasses that hung over the water.</p>

<p>Beate could not get tired of looking at the
pretty little island. Willow bushes grew out of
the grass in some places, and in one end grew
a little white-barked birch tree. Beate thought
she had never seen anything half so lovely. It
seemed just like a strange little land, all by itself.</p>

<p>At last Beate remembered that she must hurry
home. Again she peeped through the leaves and
branches to say good-night to the island, when&mdash;think
of it!&mdash;the little green island was gone.</p>

<p>She thought of goblins and fairies, and ran up
the path to the top of the hill as fast as she could.
But when she got there she had to look again.
And she became more astonished than ever, for
now she saw the little green island again, but far
from the place where she first saw it. It was
sailing slowly toward the southern end of the lake,
and the silver birch was its sail.</p>

<p>As soon as Beate reached home she found
Anne, the nurse, and told her what she had seen.</p>

<p>Anne knew all about the floating island: it
had been on the lake for many years, she said.
But there were many strange things about it.
One thing she would tell, and that was, that if
anyone stood on the floating island and took a
loon&#8217;s egg out of the nest and wished for something,
that wish would come true, if the egg was
put safely back into the nest again. If you wished
to become a Princess of England, your wish
would indeed be fulfilled, said old Anne. But
there was one more thing to notice: you must not
talk about it to a living soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even to Father and Mother?&rdquo; asked
Beate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;not to a living soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beate could think of nothing but the island
all that evening, and when she had closed her
eyes she could dream of nothing else all night.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Beate got up in the morning she
begged her father to row her and Marie and
Louise out to the floating island, when they came
to visit her in the afternoon, and that he promised.</p>

<p>But he also asked how she had happened to
think of that, and what she wanted there. Beate
thought first that she would tell him everything,
but then she remembered Anne&#8217;s words, and said
only that she wished to go out there because the
little green island was so pretty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, it is pretty, and you shall see a
loon&#8217;s nest too,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>Then Beate&#8217;s face grew red, and the tears
came to her eyes, for she knew well enough
about the loon&#8217;s nest and about the eggs.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the father took the three little
girls down to the lake. Beate&#8217;s friends thought
this was the loveliest place they had ever seen,
and they begged the father to stop and get some
of the pretty water-lilies for them. But Beate
was longing for the floating island.</p>

<p>The father rowed close up to the island and
around it, and when he came to the other side the
loon plunged out of the reeds into the water and
was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the loon&#8217;s nest,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>What joy! The loon&#8217;s nest was on the very
edge of the little tiny island, hidden among the
grasses, and in the nest were two big grayish-brown
eggs, with black spots, larger than any
goose eggs.</p>

<p>Marie and Louise shouted and laughed, but
Beate felt strangely frightened and was very
quiet. She begged her father to let her stand
on the island, only a minute, and would he let
her take one of the eggs in her hand?</p>

<p>The father told her she must be very careful
just lift the egg gently between her two fingers,
for if the bird noticed that the egg had been
touched she would not hatch it.</p>

<p>And now Beate stood on the green floating
island. She was excited when she bent down to
pick up the grayish-brown egg, but lifted it carefully
between two fingers. Now she might wish
for anything in the wide, wide world.</p>

<p>And what do you think she wished for? To
become a Princess of England? Oh, no, she knew
something far better than that. Then her lips
moved softly, and she whispered to herself: &ldquo;I
wish that Little Beate was with me once more,
and would never, never leave me.&rdquo; Carefully
she put the egg back into the nest.</p>

<p>What was the pink something her eye now
caught sight of among the tall reeds close to the
nest? It was her doll! Beate gave one shriek
of joy. &ldquo;Little Beate, my own Little Beate,&rdquo; she
sobbed, when she had her own dearest friend in
her arms again. She covered her with tears and
kisses, and held her tight in her arms as if she
would never in the world let her go.</p>

<p>Her father, Marie, and Louise stood by without
saying a word. At last the father kissed his little
girl, and lifted her on to the raft again.</p>

<p>Such a birthday party as Beate had now!
What did it matter that a year&#8217;s rains and snows
had faded Little Beate&#8217;s cheeks and bleached
her brown curls? She was the guest of honor,
and sat on the prettiest chair. She had all the
cookies and chocolate that she wanted. She was
petted and loved; and at night, tired and happy,
Big Beate slept with her little friend in her arms.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>HANS, THE OLD SOLDIER</strong></p>

<p>Viggo was Beate&#8217;s brother. He was 10 years
old. Hans was Viggo&#8217;s dearest friend. The
servants on the farm called the old Grenadier
&ldquo;Hans the Watchdog,&rdquo; for they said when he
talked to anyone it sounded like a dog barking,
and he looked as if he were ready to bite. But
Viggo had once said that the Grenadier&#8217;s voice
sounded like the rattle of a drum, and the old
soldier thought that was well said. It was from
that time on that Viggo and Hans were such
good friends.</p>

<p>Hans the Grenadier was six feet two, and a
little more. He was straight as a stick. His hair
was long and snowy white, and it hung in a
braid down his red soldier&#8217;s coat.</p>

<p>When he came walking up to the farm from
his little cottage he always carried the ax on
the left shoulder, like a gun, and marched stiff
and straight, and kept step as if the sergeant were
marching right at his heels, commanding &ldquo;Left,
right! Left, right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viggo knew that sometimes Old Hans was
willing to tell about the time he served in the
army. He told of the battles, and first and last
about the &ldquo;Prince of &#8217;Gustenberg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a man!&rdquo; said Hans. &ldquo;When he looked
at you it was as if he would eat you in one
bite. And such a nose between the eyes! The
Prince of &#8217;Gustenberg had a nose that shouted
&lsquo;Get out of my way!&rsquo; And therefore they did
get put of his way, too, wherever he showed
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the Prince of &#8217;Gustenberg
said when he spoke in front of the troops? &lsquo;One
thing is a shame,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and that is to turn
your back before retreat is called.&rsquo; And now you
know what is a shame, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viggo sat silent a little while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you never known a little boy to become
a general?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&#8217;t, but I have known a drummer
boy to become a sergeant. He was not much
bigger than you. He could do everything you
can think of. There was one thing, though, that
was very hard for him to do, and that was to
beat &lsquo;Retreat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Forward March&rsquo; he knew how to
drum; he never forgot that, and sometimes he
beat that instead of &lsquo;Retreat,&rsquo; and the captain got
angry. Usually he wasn&#8217;t punished either, because
he had once saved the captain&#8217;s life with
a snowball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a snowball?&rdquo; said Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said snowball; he did not use greater
means. We were rushing up a hill with the
enemy in front of us. It was in Winter. The
captain and the drummer boy led the march; but
as soon as they came to the top of the hill there
stood the enemy in line. &lsquo;Aim!&rsquo; commanded the
enemy&#8217;s officer, and all the guns pointed right
at the captain. Quick as lightning the drummer
boy grabbed a handful of snow and made a snowball,
and, just as the officer opened his mouth
to say &lsquo;Fire!&rsquo; the drummer boy threw the snowball
straight into the open mouth. He stood there,
mouth wide open. Well, then the rest of us
arrived and we had a hot fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then was he made a sergeant?&rdquo; asked Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when the Prince had heard of it. He
was given the rank of a sergeant, and something
better even than that. The Prince called him
&lsquo;my son.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was too bad that they didn&#8217;t make him a
general,&rdquo; said Viggo. He added half aloud:
&ldquo;Do you think I might become a general, Hans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, listen to the spring chicken!&rdquo; said
Hans. &ldquo;So it is general you want to be? Never
mind, don&#8217;t blush for that; it wasn&#8217;t a bad
question. But it is very difficult, for you must
learn much, oh, very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mathematics, you mean?&rdquo; said Viggo. &ldquo;I have
learned some of that already, and languages
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is well enough, but you must learn
much more; you must learn to drill so that you
don&#8217;t make a mistake in a single movement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do you think I might become a general?&rdquo;
continued Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows? But it is difficult. The eyes
are not bad, you have the right expression. But
the nose&mdash;no it has not the correct shape. But,
of course, it may grow and curve in time,&rdquo; said
Old Hans.</p>

<p>After that Viggo learned to drill and march
from his old friend; but he often looked in the
mirror and wished with all his heart that the
nose would curve a little more.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>ALLARM, THE DOG</strong></p>

<p>One afternoon Viggo was walking home from
school with a bag of books on his back. He
marched straight as a stick, with a soldiery step.
Old Hans was standing outside the cottage waiting
for him, and when Viggo halted and saluted,
the old man asked if he could guess what present
there was for him at the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does it look?&rdquo; asked Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is brown,&rdquo; said Hans. &ldquo;Now guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose it is nothing but a lump of
brown sugar from Aunt Beate,&rdquo; said Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try again!&rdquo; said Hans, and grinned. &ldquo;It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
dark brown, it walks on four feet and laps milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the puppy the Captain has promised me?
Is it?&rdquo; cried Viggo, and forgot all about standing
straight and stiff before the Grenadier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right about! Of course that&#8217;s what it is,&rdquo;
said Hans the Grenadier.</p>

<p>But Viggo turned a somersault instead of
&ldquo;Right about&rdquo; and ran to the house. On a piece
of carpet close by the fireplace lay the little
puppy, and he was beautiful. The body was dark
brown, but the nose and paws were light brown,
and he had a light brown spot over each eye.
When Viggo sat down on the floor beside him
and stroked the soft fur, he licked Viggo&#8217;s hand.
Soon they had become acquainted, and from that
time on Viggo watched, to see if the puppy
grew, almost as carefully as he watched his own
nose to see if it had the proper curve so that
he might become a general.</p>

<p>In the night, Allarm lay by Viggo&#8217;s bed, and
in the daytime sat beside him when he was
studying his lessons. The puppy was not allowed
to go along to school, but he met Viggo every
afternoon, and barked with joy and wagged his
tail.</p>

<p>One winter morning Hans the Grenadier and
some of the farm hands were going to the woods
to haul timber with seven horses. Viggo had a
holiday that day, so he was allowed to go along.
He put his rubber boots on, and whistled for
Allarm. The puppy jumped and barked when he
noticed that they were off for the woods. But
Viggo&#8217;s father said it would be best to leave
Allarm at home, for there were packs of wolves
in the woods. Viggo did not like to leave Allarm
behind, but when his father said so of course
he must do it. He took the strap and tied Allarm
to the leg of the sofa. Then he put his old coat
on the floor beside the dog, so that he might be
comfortable. But you can&#8217;t imagine how Allarm
whined and howled when he understood that he
was to be left tied up.</p>

<p>Viggo told his father that he could not stand
it to have Allarm so sad, happen what would,
and he begged that he might take him along.</p>

<p>The father smiled, and said if Viggo wanted
to risk it he must take good care of the dog,
and not let him out of his sight. Then they untied
him, and you may imagine Allarm&#8217;s joy. He
jumped and barked so that the mother had to put
her fingers in her ears.</p>

<p>The seven horses went in a line, one after the
other, and Hans the Grenadier and Viggo and
Allarm walked behind the last one. The forest
was so still you could not hear the least sound
except the horses&#8217; hoofs crunching in the snow.
Here and there Viggo saw the foot-prints of a
wolf beside the road. Then he always told Allarm
to keep close by him, and that he did.</p>

<p>But after awhile they left the road and turned
into the thick forest. Hans the Grenadier waded
in front, and the snow reached to his knees; then
came the horses and the boys, one after the other,
and at last Viggo.</p>

<p>After a while they came to the logs and began
to hitch them to the horses. Then suddenly Viggo
remembered Allarm; he had forgotten all about
the dog since they turned away from the road.
He looked around him, and just then he heard
Allarm whine and howl somewhere in the depths
of the forest.</p>

<p>As quick as lightning he grabbed an ax which
Old Hans had driven into a stump, and rushed
in through the trees in the direction from which
the howling came. It was not easy; the snow
reached far above his knees, but he noticed nothing:
he only feared he would be too late. Once
he had to stop a little to draw breath, then again
he heard the pitiful wail of the dog, but now it
sounded fainter. Off Viggo rushed again, and at
last he espied something between the trees. He
did not see his dog, but three wolves stood in a
circle, heads turned toward the center; the fourth
one lay inside the ring and bit something in the
snow.</p>

<p>Viggo shouted so that it thundered in the forest,
and rushed against the wolves with lifted ax.
When he came within seven or eight feet of them,
the three grey-legs took fright and sneaked, tails
between legs, far into the forest; but the fourth,
who lay on top of Allarm, hated to give up his
prey. It was a large yellow wolf, and it looked
up at Viggo and showed sharp, bloody teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go of Allarm! Let go of my dog, or I&#8217;ll
teach you!&rdquo; he cried, and swung the ax high
above his head. Then grey-legs sneaked slowly
away after the others. He turned once and
howled, and showed his teeth, and then disappeared
among the bushes.</p>

<p>Far down in a hole in the snow lay Allarm.
He was so bitten that he could not jump to his
feet; and, when Viggo lifted him, the blood
dripped down on the snow. His whole body
shivered, but he licked Viggo&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Just then Old Hans the Grenadier stood by
Viggo&#8217;s side. When he had gained his breath
after his hurried run, the old man cried very
angrily: &ldquo;If I did what you deserve I should
have to whip you. Do you think it fit for a
youngster like you to rush against a pack of
wolves? If they had eaten you up alive before
you had a chance to make a sound, what would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
you have said then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I would have said: &lsquo;One thing is a
shame, and that is to turn your back before
&ldquo;retreat&rdquo; is called,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Viggo, and looked
sharply at the Grenadier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well said, my boy! The nose has not quite
the right curve yet, but the eyes are there, and
I do believe the heart, too,&rdquo; said Old Hans. He
took the dog from Viggo, and went home with
both of them.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE BLACK POND</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, the Black Pond is frozen! The ice
is more than an inch thick, and there&#8217;s a crowd
of boys down there!&rdquo; shouted one of Viggo&#8217;s
classmates one morning, as he thrust his frost-covered
head through the door and swung his
skates. It didn&#8217;t take Viggo long before he
got his skates down from the nail, and ran off
with his friend. And he was so anxious to get
down to the lake that he forgot to whistle for
Allarm.</p>

<p>But Allarm had a fine nose. Just as soon
as he had swallowed his breakfast he understood
that Viggo was gone. Then he ran out hunting
through the yard for Viggo&#8217;s trail, and when
he noticed that it didn&#8217;t lead to the school he
knew he might follow. Then he rushed madly
after him over the fields, and had caught up with
him long before Viggo had reached the cottage
of Hans the Grenadier, which lay close by the
lake.</p>

<p>One thing Viggo had promised his father before
he got permission to go, and that was that
he would be very careful and not skate far out
from the shore. Near the middle of the lake
there was an air hole through which warm air
rose to the surface, and there the ice was never
thick.</p>

<p>And Viggo meant honestly to do what his
father had told him, but now you shall hear
what happened.</p>

<p>When he came to the lake there was a crowd
of boys there. There must have been twenty or
more. Most of them had skates on, but some
only slid on the ice. They shouted and laughed
so that you could not hear yourself think.</p>

<p>As soon as Viggo had put on his skates he
began to look around. Most of the boys he
knew, for he had raced with them before, and he
felt that he could beat every one of them. But
there was one boy who skated by himself, and
seemed not to care about the others. He was
much bigger than Viggo, and Viggo saw immediately
that it would not be easy to beat him in
a race. The boys called him Peter Lightfoot, and
the name fitted him. He could do the corkscrew,
skate backward as easily as forward, and lie so
low and near the ice that he might have kissed it.
But all this Viggo could do, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you write your initials?&rdquo; asked Viggo.
Yes; Peter Lightfoot stood on one leg and wrote
&ldquo;P. L.&rdquo; in the ice, but the letters hung together.
Then Viggo started. He ran, turned himself
around backward and wrote &ldquo;P. L.,&rdquo; and between
the &ldquo;P.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;L.&rdquo; he made a short jump so
that the letters stood apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Viggo! He wrote Peter Lightfoot
backward!&rdquo; shouted the boys, and threw up their
caps. Then the big boy blushed crimson, but he
said nothing.</p>

<p>Now they began to play &ldquo;Fox and Geese,&rdquo; and
everybody wanted Viggo to be the fox. Peter
wanted to play, too, for he was sure that Viggo
could not catch him. The race-course was
scratched in the ice, and Viggo called, &ldquo;Out, out,
my geese,&rdquo; and off they ran. But Viggo didn&#8217;t
care to run after the little goslings, it was the
big gander, Peter Lightfoot, he wished to catch.
And that was a game!</p>

<p>Off they went, Peter in front and Viggo after
him, back and forth in corners and circles, and
all the other boys stopped and looked on. Every
time Viggo was right at his heels, Peter jumped
and was far ahead of the fox again. At last
Viggo had him cornered, but just as he would
have caught the goose, Peter stretched out his
left leg and meant to trip Viggo, but his skate
caught in a frozen twig and&mdash;thump! there lay
Peter Lightfoot, the ice cracking all around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thing he wasn&#8217;t made of glass,&rdquo;
laughed the boys and crowded around Peter. He
got up and looked angrily around the circle of
boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now stand in a row, we&#8217;ll jump,&rdquo; said he,
and the boys did. They piled hats and caps on
top of each other first only three high. The
whole row jumped that, then four, then five, then
six, but each time fewer got over and those who
pushed the top cap off with their skates had to
stop playing and must stand aside and look on.
At last there were eight hats and caps on top of
each other, and now only Peter and Viggo were
left to jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your cap on top!&rdquo; said Peter, and Viggo
did. But all the boys shouted that no one could
ever make that jump.</p>

<p>Now, Peter came so fast that the air whistled
about him, jumped&mdash;and whiff! he was over! He
touched Viggo&#8217;s cap the least little bit, but it did
not fall off the pile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Peter! That was a masterly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
jump!&rdquo; shouted the boys. &ldquo;Viggo can never do
that, he is too small,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>Viggo knew this was the test, and his heart
beat fast. He ran with all his might. Viggo
flew over like a bird, and there was at least four
inches between his skates and the topmost cap.
Then the boys crowded around him and shouted
that Viggo was the champion. But Peter Lightfoot
looked at him with a sly and evil eye, and
you could see he was planning to play a trick
on him. And, indeed, that&#8217;s what he did.</p>

<p>After a little while Peter took an apple out
of his pocket and rolled it over the ice toward
the airhole. &ldquo;The one who dares to go for the
apple may keep it!&rdquo; he called. And many dared
to try that, for the apple had not rolled far and
the ice was strong enough. Now Peter threw an
apple farther out, someone got that too. But at
last he rolled one that stopped right on the edge
of the open water. One boy after the other ran
out toward it, but when the ice began to crack
they slowly turned around again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t do it, it is dangerous!&rdquo; shouted Viggo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Viggo is great when things are easy,
but if there is danger he turns pale as a ghost,&rdquo;
said Peter, and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>This was more than Viggo could bear. He
thought of what the Prince of Augustenburg had
said before the front, and he thought he must
fetch the apple, come what might. But he forgot
that &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; had been called, for his father had
forbidden him to go near the hole. Allarm looked
at him with grave eyes and wagged his tail
slowly; he did not dare to whine. But that did
not help. Viggo ran so that the wind whistled
about his ears. The ice bent under his feet and
cracked, but he glided on and on, and the ice did
not break. Now he was close by the apple; he
bent down to pick it up&mdash;crash! The ice broke,
and Viggo, head first, fell in.</p>

<p>In a minute his head appeared above the hole.
He swam for the ice and seized the edge, but
a piece broke off every time he tried to climb up.</p>

<p>At first the boys stood there dumb with fright.
Then they all called to him that he must try to
hold on, but no one dared to help him, and no
one thought of running for help. Peter Lightfoot
had sneaked away when Viggo fell in.</p>

<p>The best one of them all was Allarm. First
he ran yelping around the hole, but when he saw
Viggo appear again he snatched his wet cap between
his teeth and as fast as an arrow he ran
toward home. When he reached the cottage of
Hans the Grenadier the old soldier was just standing
in the open doorway. The dog put Viggo&#8217;s
stiff frozen cap at his feet, whined and cried,
jumped up on the old man, held on to his coat
and dragged him toward the ice. Hans understood
right away what was the matter, snatched
a rope and ran toward the lake, and in no time
he stood by the hole. He threw the rope to
Viggo, who had begun to grow stiff from the icy
bath, and pulled him out.</p>

<p>Viggo ran as fast as he could to the cottage
of Hans, and when he reached the door he had an
armor of shining ice over his whole body. When
the Grenadier pulled off the boy&#8217;s trousers they
could stand by themselves on the floor; they were
frozen stiff.</p>

<p>Viggo, of course, had to change from top to
toe, and what should he put on? Hans went to
his old chest and came back with his uniform.
Viggo looked rather queer; the yellow knee-trousers
reached to his ankles, and the red coat
with yellow cuffs and lapels hung on him like a
bag.</p>

<p>But he was wearing a real uniform! Hans
looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I won&#8217;t say much about the
fit of the clothes, but who knows you may wear a
better looking uniform some day. The heart is
of the right kind, and the nose&mdash;well it is doing
better.&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2>THE FOUR WHITE SWANS</h2>


<p>In the days of long ago there lived in the Green
Isle of Erin a race of brave men and fair women&mdash;the
race of the Dedannans. North, south,
east, and west did this noble people dwell, doing
homage to many chiefs.</p>

<p>But one blue morning after a great battle the
Dedannans met on a wide plain to choose a king.
&ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;have one king over all. Let
us no longer have many rulers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forth from among the princes rose five well
fitted to wield a scepter and to wear a crown, yet
most royal stood Bove Derg and Lir. And forth
did the five chiefs wander, that the Dedannan
folk might freely say to whom they would most
gladly do homage as king.</p>

<p>Not far did they roam, for soon there arose
a great cry, &ldquo;Bove Derg is King! Bove Derg
is King!&rdquo; And all were glad, save Lir.</p>

<p>But Lir was angry, and he left the plain where
the Dedannan people were, taking leave of none,
and doing Bove Derg no reverence. For jealousy
filled the heart of Lir.</p>

<p>Then were the Dedannans wroth, and a hundred
swords were unsheathed and flashed in the
sunlight on the plain. &ldquo;We go to slay Lir who
doeth not homage to our King and regardeth not
the choice of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But wise and generous was Bove Derg, and
he bade the warriors do no hurt to the offended
prince.</p>

<p>For long years did Lir live in discontent, yielding
obedience to none. But at length a great sorrow
fell upon him, for his wife, who was dear
unto him, died, and she had been ill but three
days. Loudly did he lament her death, and
heavy was his heart with sorrow.</p>

<p>When tidings of Lir&#8217;s grief reached Bove
Derg, he was surrounded by his mightiest chiefs.
&ldquo;Go forth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in fifty chariots go forth.
Tell Lir I am his friend as ever, and ask that
he come with you hither. Three fair foster-children
are mine, and one may he yet have to wife,
will he but bow to the will of the people, who
have chosen me their King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When these words were told to Lir, his heart
was glad. Speedily he called around him his
train, and in fifty chariots set forth. Nor did
they slacken speed until they reached the palace
of Bove Derg by the Great Lake. And there at
the still close of day, as the setting rays of the
sun fell athwart the silver waters, did Lir do
homage to Bove Derg. And Bove Derg kissed
Lir and vowed to be his friend forever.</p>

<p>And when it was known throughout the
Dedannan host that peace reigned between these
mighty chiefs, brave men and fair women and
little children rejoiced, and nowhere were there
happier hearts than in the Green Isle of Erin.</p>

<p>Time passed, and Lir still dwelt with Bove
Derg in his palace by the Great Lake. One
morning the King said: &ldquo;Full well thou knowest
my three fair foster-daughters, nor have I forgotten
my promise that one thou shouldst have
to wife. Choose her whom thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Lir answered: &ldquo;All are indeed fair, and
choice is hard. But give unto me the eldest, if
it be that she be willing to wed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Eve, the eldest of the fair maidens, was
glad, and that day was she married to Lir, and
after two weeks she left the palace by the Great
Lake and drove with her husband to her new
home.</p>

<p>Happily dwelt Lir&#8217;s household and merrily
sped the months. Then were born unto Lir twin
babes. The girl they called Finola, and her
brother did they name Aed.</p>

<p>Yet another year passed and again twins were
born, but before the infant boys knew their
mother, she died. So sorely did Lir grieve for
his beautiful wife that he would have died of
sorrow, but for the great love he bore his
motherless children.</p>

<p>When news of Eve&#8217;s death reached the palace
of Bove Derg by the Great Lake all mourned
aloud, for love of Eve and sore pity for Lir and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
his four babes. And Bove Derg said to his
mighty chiefs: &ldquo;Great, indeed is our grief, but
in this dark hour shall Lir know our friendship.
Ride forth, make known to him that Eva, my
second fair foster-child, shall in time become his
wedded wife and shall cherish his lone babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So messengers rode forth to carry these tidings
to Lir, and in time Lir came again to the
palace of Bove Derg by the Great Lake, and
he married the beautiful Eva and took her back
with him to his little daughter, Finola, and to
her three brothers, Aed and Fiacra and Conn.</p>

<p>Four lovely and gentle children they were, and
with tenderness did Eva care for the little ones
who were their father&#8217;s joy and the pride of the
Dedannans.</p>

<p>As for Lir, so great was the love he bore them,
that at early dawn he would rise, and, pulling
aside the deerskin that separated his
sleeping-room from theirs, would fondle and frolic with
the children until morning broke.</p>

<p>And Bove Derg loved them well-nigh as did
Lir himself. Ofttimes would he come to see them
and ofttimes were they brought to his palace by
the Great Lake.</p>

<p>And through all the Green Isle, where dwelt
the Dedannan people, there also was spread the
fame of the beauty of the children of Lir.</p>

<p>Time crept on, and Finola was a maid of
twelve summers. Then did a wicked jealousy
find root in Eva&#8217;s heart, and so did it grow that
it strangled the love which she had borne her
sister&#8217;s children. In bitterness she cried: &ldquo;Lir
careth not for me; to Finola and her brothers
hath he given all his love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for weeks and months Eva lay in bed
planning how she might do hurt to the children
of Lir.</p>

<p>At length, one midsummer morn, she ordered
forth her chariot, that with the four children
she might come to the palace of Bove Derg.</p>

<p>When Finola heard it, her fair face grew pale,
for in a dream had it been revealed unto her
that Eva, her stepmother, should that day do a
dark deed among those of her own household.
Therefore was Finola sore afraid, but only her
large eyes and pale cheeks spake her woe, as
she and her brothers drove along with Eva and
her train.</p>

<p>On they drove, the boys laughing merrily,
heedless alike of the black shadow resting on
their stepmother&#8217;s brow, and of the pale, trembling
lips of their sister. As they reached a
gloomy pass, Eva whispered to her attendants:
&ldquo;Kill, I pray you, these children of Lir, for their
father careth not for me, because of his great
love for them. Kill them, and great wealth shall
be yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the attendants answered in horror: &ldquo;We
will not kill them. Fearful, O Eva, were the deed,
and great is the evil that will befall thee, for having
it in thine heart to do this thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Eva, filled with rage, drew forth her
sword to slay them with her own hand, but too
weak for the monstrous deed, she sank back in
the chariot.</p>

<p>Onward they drove, out of the gloomy pass
into the bright sunlight of the white road.
Daisies with wide-open eyes looked up into the
blue sky overhead. Golden glistened the buttercups
among the shamrock. From the ditches
peeped forget-me-not. Honeysuckle scented the
hedgerows. Around, above, and afar, caroled
the linnet, the lark, and the thrush. All was
color and sunshine, scent and song, as the children
of Lir drove onward to their doom.</p>

<p>Not until they reached a still lake were the
horses unyoked for rest. There Eva bade the
children undress and go bathe in the waters.
And when the children of Lir reached the
water&#8217;s edge, Eva was there behind them, holding
in her hand a fairy wand. And with the wand
she touched the shoulder of each. And, lo! as
she touched Finola, the maiden was changed into
a snow-white swan, and behold! as she touched
Aed, Fiacra, and Conn, the three brothers were
as the maid. Four snow-white swans floated on
the blue lake, and to them the wicked Eva
chanted a song of doom.</p>

<p>As she finished, the swans turned toward her,
and Finola spake:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evil is the deed thy magic wand hath
wrought, O Eva, on us the children of Lir, but
greater evil shall befall thee, because of the
hardness and jealousy of thine heart.&rdquo; And
Finola&#8217;s white swan-breast heaved as she sang
of their pitiless doom.</p>

<p>The song ended, again spake the swan-maiden:
&ldquo;Tell us, O Eva, when death shall set us free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Eva made answer: &ldquo;Three hundred years
shall your home be on the smooth waters of this
lone lake. Three hundred years shall ye pass
on the stormy waters of the sea betwixt Erin
and Alba, and three hundred years shall ye be
tempest-tossed on the wild Western Sea. Until
Decca be the Queen of Largnen, and the good
saint come to Erin, and ye hear the chime of the
Christ-bell, neither your plaints nor prayers,
neither the love of your father Lir, nor the might
of your King, Bove Derg, shall have power to
deliver you from your doom. But lone white
swans though ye be, ye shall keep forever your
own sweet Gaelic speech, and ye shall sing, with
plaintive voices, songs so haunting that your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
music will bring peace to the souls of those who
hear. And still beneath your snowy plumage
shall beat the hearts of Finola, Aed, Fiacra and
Conn, and still forever shall ye be the children
of Lir.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">four snow-white swans floated on the blue lake</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then did Eva order the horses to be yoked to
the chariot, and away westward did she drive.</p>

<p>And swimming on the lone lake were four
white swans.</p>

<p>When Eva reached the palace of Bove Derg
alone, greatly was he troubled lest evil had befallen
the children of Lir.</p>

<p>But the attendants, because of their great fear
of Eva, dared not to tell the King of the magic
spell she had wrought by the way. Therefore
Bove Derg asked, &ldquo;Wherefore, O Eva, come not
Finola and her brothers to the palace this day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Eva answered: &ldquo;Because, O King, Lir
no longer trusteth thee, therefore would he not
let the children come hither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bove Derg believed not his foster-daughter,
and that night he secretly sent messengers
across the hills to the dwelling of Lir.</p>

<p>When the messengers came there, and told
their errand, great was the grief of the father.
And in the morning with a heavy heart he summoned
a company of the Dedannans, and together
they set out for the palace of Bove Derg.
And it was not until sunset as they reached the
lone shore of Lake Darvra, that they slackened
speed.</p>

<p>Lir alighted from his chariot and stood spellbound.
What was that plaintive sound? The
Gaelic words, his dear daughter&#8217;s voice more enchanting
even than of old, and yet, before and
around, only the lone blue lake. The haunting
music rang clearer, and as the last words died
away, four snow-white swans glided from behind
the sedges, and with a wild flap of wings
flew toward the eastern shore. There, stricken
with wonder, stood Lir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know, O Lir,&rdquo; said Finola, &ldquo;that we are thy
children, changed by the wicked magic of our
stepmother into four white swans.&rdquo; When Lir
and the Dedannan people heard these words,
they wept aloud.</p>

<p>Still spake the swan-maiden: &ldquo;Three hundred
years must we float on this lone lake, three hundred
years shall we be storm-tossed on the
waters between Erin and Alba, and three hundred
years on the wild Western Sea. Not until
Decca be the Queen of Largnen, not until the
good saint come to Erin and the chime of the
Christ-bell be heard in the land, not until then
shall we be saved from our doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then great cries of sorrow went up from the
Dedannans, and again Lir sobbed aloud. But
at the last silence fell upon his grief, and Finola
told how she and her brothers would keep forever
their own sweet Gaelic speech, how they
would sing songs so haunting that their music
would bring peace to the souls of all who heard.
She told how, beneath their snowy plumage, the
human hearts of Finola, Aed, Fiacra, and Conn
should still beat&mdash;the hearts of the children of
Lir. &ldquo;Stay with us to-night by the lone lake,&rdquo;
she ended, &ldquo;and our music will steal to you
across its moonlit waters and lull you into peaceful
slumber. Stay, stay with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Lir and his people stayed on the shore
that night and until the morning glimmered.
Then, with the dim dawn, silence stole over the
lake.</p>

<p>Speedily did Lir rise, and in haste did he bid
farewell to his children, that he might seek Eva
and see her tremble before him.</p>

<p>Swiftly did he drive and straight, until he
came to the palace of Bove Derg, and there by
the waters of the Great Lake did Bove Derg
meet him. &ldquo;Oh, Lir, wherefore have thy children
come not hither?&rdquo; And Eva stood by the
King.</p>

<p>Stern and sad rang the answer of Lir: &ldquo;Alas!
Eva, your foster-child, hath by her wicked magic
changed them into four snow-white swans. On
the blue waters of Lake Darvra dwell Finola,
Aed, Fiacra, and Conn, and thence come I that
I may avenge their doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence as the silence of death fell upon the
three, and all was still save that Eva trembled
greatly. But ere long Bove Derg spake. Fierce
and angry did he look, as, high above his foster-daughter,
he held his magic wand. Awful was
his voice as he pronounced her doom: &ldquo;Wretched
woman, henceforth shalt thou no longer darken
this fair earth, but as a demon of the air shalt
thou dwell in misery till the end of time.&rdquo; And
of a sudden from out her shoulders grew black,
shadowy wings, and, with a piercing scream, she
swirled upward, until the awe-stricken Dedannans
saw nought save a black speck vanish
among the lowering clouds. And as a demon of
the air do Eva&#8217;s black wings swirl her through
space to this day.</p>

<p>But great and good was Bove Derg. He laid
aside his magic wand and so spake: &ldquo;Let us, my
people, leave the Great Lake, and let us pitch
our tents on the shores of Lake Darvra. Exceeding
dear unto us are the children of Lir, and
I, Bove Derg, and Lir, their father, have vowed
henceforth to make our home forever by the
lone waters where they dwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when it was told throughout the Green
Island of Erin of the fate of the children of Lir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and of the vow that Bove Derg had vowed, from
north, south, east, and west did the Dedannans
flock to the lake, until a mighty host dwelt by
its shores.</p>

<p>And by day Finola and her brothers knew not
loneliness, for in the sweet Gaelic speech they
told of their joys and fears; and by night the
mighty Dedannans knew no sorrowful memories,
for by haunting songs were they lulled to sleep,
and the music brought peace to their souls.</p>

<p>Slowly did the years go by, and upon the
shoulders of Bove Derg and Lir fell the long
white hair. Fearful grew the four swans, for
the time was not far off when they must wing
their flight north to the wild sea of Moyle.</p>

<p>And when at length the sad day dawned,
Finola told her brothers how their three hundred
happy years on Lake Darvra were at an end,
and how they must now leave the peace of its
lone waters for evermore.</p>

<p>Then, slowly and sadly, did the four swans
glide to the margin of the lake. Never had the
snowy whiteness of their plumage so dazzled the
beholders, never had music so sweet and sorrowful
floated to Lake Darvra&#8217;s sunlit shores. As
the swans reached the water&#8217;s edge, silent were
the three brothers, and alone Finola chanted a
farewell song.</p>

<p>With bowed white heads did the Dedannan
host listen to Finola&#8217;s chant, and when the music
ceased and only sobs broke the stillness, the four
swans spread their wings, and, soaring high,
paused but for one short moment to gaze on the
kneeling forms of Lir and Bove Derg. Then,
stretching their graceful necks toward the north,
they winged their flight to the waters of the
stormy sea that separates the blue Alba from
the Green Island of Erin.</p>

<p>And when it was known throughout the Green
Isle that the four white swans had flown, so
great was the sorrow of the people that they
made a law that no swan should be killed in Erin
from that day forth.</p>

<p>With hearts that burned with longing for their
father and their friends, did Finola and her
brothers reach the sea of Moyle. Cold were its
wintry waters, black and fearful were the steep
rocks overhanging Alba&#8217;s far-stretching coasts.
From hunger, too, the swans suffered. Dark
indeed was all, and darker yet as the children of
Lir remembered the still waters of Lake Darvra
and the fond Dedannan host on its peaceful
shores. Here the sighing of the wind among the
reeds no longer soothed their sorrow, but the
roar of the breaking surf struck fresh terror in
their souls. In misery and terror did their days
pass, until one night the black, lowering clouds
overhead told that a great tempest was nigh.
Then did Finola call to her Aed, Fiacra, and
Conn. &ldquo;Beloved brothers, a great fear is at my
heart, for, in the fury of the coming gale, we
may be driven the one from the other. Therefore,
let us say where we may hope to meet when
the storm is spent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Aed answered: &ldquo;Wise art thou, dear, gentle
sister. If we be driven apart, may it be to
meet again on the rocky isle that has ofttimes
been our haven, for well known is it to us all,
and from far can it be seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darker grew the night, louder raged the wind,
as the four swans dived and rose again on the
giant billows. Yet fiercer blew the gale, until
at midnight loud bursts of thunder mingled with
the roaring wind, but, in the glare of the blue
lightning&#8217;s flashes, the children of Lir beheld
each the snowy form of the other. The mad
fury of the hurricane yet increased, and the
force of it lifted one swan from its wild home
on the billows, and swept it through the blackness
of the night. Another blue lightning-flash,
and each swan saw its loneliness, and uttered a
great cry of desolation. Tossed hither and
thither by wind and wave, the white birds were
well-nigh dead when dawn broke. And with the
dawn fell calm.</p>

<p>Swift as her tired wings would bear her,
Finola sailed to the rocky isle, where she hoped
to find her brothers. But alas! no sign was there
of one of them. Then to the highest summit of
the rocks she flew. North, south, east, and west
did she look, yet nought saw she save a watery
wilderness. Now did her heart fail her, and she
sang the saddest song she had yet sung.</p>

<p>As the last notes died Finola raised her eyes,
and lo! Conn came slowly swimming toward her
with drenched plumage and head that drooped.
And as she looked, behold! Fiacra appeared, but
it was as though his strength failed. Then did
Finola swim toward her fainting brother and
lend him her aid, and soon the twins were safe
on the sunlit rock, nestling for warmth beneath
their sister&#8217;s wings.</p>

<p>Yet Finola&#8217;s heart still beat with alarm as she
sheltered her younger brothers, for Aed came
not, and she feared lest he were lost forever.
But, at noon, sailing he came over the breast of
the blue waters, with head erect and plumage
sunlit. And under the feathers of her breast
did Finola draw him, for Conn and Fiacra still
cradled beneath her wings. &ldquo;Rest here, while
ye may, dear brothers,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And she sang to them a lullaby so surpassing
sweet that the sea-birds hushed their cries and
flocked to listen to the sad, slow music. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
when Aed and Fiacra and Conn were lulled to
sleep, Finola&#8217;s notes grew more and more faint
and her head drooped, and soon she, too, slept
peacefully in the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>But few were the sunny days on the sea of
Moyle, and many were the tempests that ruffled
its waters. Still keener grew the winter frosts,
and the misery of the four white swans was
greater than ever before. Even their most sorrowful
Gaelic songs told not half their woe.
From the fury of the storm they still sought
shelter on that rocky isle where Finola had despaired
of seeing her dear ones more.</p>

<p>Slowly passed the years of doom, until one
midwinter a frost more keen than any known
before froze the sea into a floor of solid black
ice. By night the swans crouched together on
the rocky isle for warmth, but each morning they
were frozen to the ground and could free themselves
only with sore pain, for they left clinging
to the ice-bound rock the soft down of their
breasts, the quills from their white wings, and
the skin of their poor feet.</p>

<p>And when the sun melted the ice-bound surface
of the waters, and the swans swam once
more in the sea of Moyle, the salt water entered
their wounds, and they well-nigh died of pain.
But in time the down on their breasts and the
feathers on their wings grew, and they were
healed of their wounds.</p>

<p>The years dragged on, and by day Finola and
her brothers would fly toward the shores of the
Green Island of Erin, or to the rocky blue headlands
of Alba, or they would swim far out into
a dim gray wilderness of waters. But ever as
night fell it was their doom to return to the sea
of Moyle.</p>

<p>One day, as they looked toward the Green
Isle, they saw coming to the coast a troop of
horsemen mounted on snow-white steeds, and
their armor glittered in the sun.</p>

<p>A cry of great joy went up from the children
of Lir, for they had seen no human form since
they spread their wings above Lake Darvra, and
flew to the stormy sea of Moyle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Finola to her brothers, &ldquo;speak,
and say if these be not our own Dedannan folk.&rdquo;
And Aed and Fiacra and Conn strained their
eyes, and Aed answered, &ldquo;It seemeth, dear sister,
to me, that it is indeed our own people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the horsemen drew nearer and saw the
four swans, each man shouted in the Gaelic
tongue, &ldquo;Behold the children of Lir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Finola and her brothers heard once
more the sweet Gaelic speech, and saw the faces
of their own people, their happiness was greater
than can be told. For long they were silent, but
at length Finola spake.</p>

<p>Of their life on the sea of Moyle she told, of
the dreary rains and blustering winds, of the
giant waves and the roaring thunder, of the black
frost, and of their own poor battered and
wounded bodies. Of their loneliness of soul, of
that she could not speak. &ldquo;But tell us,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;tell us of our father, Lir. Lives he still,
and Bove Derg, and our dear Dedannan
friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarce could the Dedannans speak for the sorrow
they had for Finola and her brothers, but
they told how Lir and Bove Derg were alive and
well, and were even now celebrating the Feast
of Age at the house of Lir. &ldquo;But for their longing
for you, your father and friends would be
happy indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Glad then and of great comfort were the
hearts of Finola and her brothers. But they
could not hear more, for they must hasten to fly
from the pleasant shores of Erin to the sea-stream
of Moyle, which was their doom. And
as they flew, Finola sang, and faint floated her
voice over the kneeling host.</p>

<p>As the sad song grew fainter and more faint,
the Dedannans wept aloud. Then, as the snow-white
birds faded from sight, the sorrowful company
turned the heads of their white steeds from
the shore, and rode southward to the home of
Lir.</p>

<p>And when it was told there of the sufferings
of Finola and her brothers, great was the sorrow
of the Dedannans. Yet was Lir glad that
his children were alive, and he thought of the
day when the magic spell would be broken, and
those so dear to him would be freed from their
bitter woe.</p>

<p>Once more were ended three hundred years
of doom, and glad were the four white swans to
leave the cruel sea of Moyle. Yet might they
fly only to the wild Western Sea, and tempest-tossed
as before, here they in no way escaped
the pitiless fury of wind and wave. Worse than
aught they had before endured was a frost that
drove the brothers to despair. Well-nigh frozen
to a rock, they one night cried aloud to Finola
that they longed for death. And she, too, would
fain have died.</p>

<p>But that same night did a dream come to the
swan-maiden, and, when she awoke, she cried
to her brothers to take heart. &ldquo;Believe, dear
brothers, in the great God who hath created the
earth with its fruits and the sea with its terrible
wonders. Trust in him, and he will yet save
you.&rdquo; And her brothers answered, &ldquo;We will
trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Finola also put her trust in God, and they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
all fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>When the children of Lir awoke, behold! the
sun shone, and thereafter, until the three hundred
years on the Western Sea were ended,
neither wind nor wave nor rain nor frost did
hurt the four swans.</p>

<p>On a grassy isle they lived and sang their wondrous
songs by day, and by night they nestled
together on their soft couch, and awoke in the
morning to sunshine and to peace. And there
on the grassy island was their home, until the
three hundred years were at an end. Then
Finola called to her brothers, and tremblingly
she told, and tremblingly they heard, that they
might now fly eastward to seek their own old
home.</p>

<p>Lightly did they rise on outstretched wings,
and swiftly did they fly until they reached land.
There they alighted and gazed each at the other,
but too great for speech was their joy. Then
again did they spread their wings and fly above
the green grass on and on, until they reached the
hills and trees that surrounded their old home.
But, alas! only the ruins of Lir&#8217;s dwelling were
left. Around was a wilderness overgrown with
rank grass, nettles, and weeds.</p>

<p>Too downhearted to stir, the swans slept that
night within the ruined walls of their old home,
but, when day broke, each could no longer bear
the loneliness, and again they flew westward.
And it was not until they came to Inis Glora
that they alighted. On a small lake in the heart
of the island they made their home, and, by their
enchanting music, they drew to its shores all the
birds of the west, until the lake came to be called
&ldquo;The Lake of the Bird-flocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly passed the years, but a great longing
filled the hearts of the children of Lir. When
would the good saint come to Erin? When
would the chime of the Christ-bell peal over land
and sea?</p>

<p>One rosy dawn the swans awoke among the
rushes of the Lake of the Bird-flocks, and
strange and faint was the sound that floated to
them from afar. Trembling, they nestled close
the one to the other, until the brothers stretched
their wings and fluttered hither and thither in
great fear. Yet trembling they flew back to their
sister, who had remained silent among the sedges.
Crouching by her side they asked, &ldquo;What, dear
sister, can be the strange, faint sound that steals
across our island?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With quiet, deep joy Finola answered: &ldquo;Dear
brothers, it is the chime of the Christ-bell that
ye hear, the Christ-bell of which we have
dreamed through thrice three hundred years.
Soon the spell will be broken, soon our sufferings
will end.&rdquo; Then did Finola glide from the
shelter of the sedges across the rose-lit lake, and
there by the shore of the Western Sea she
chanted a song of hope.</p>

<p>Calm crept into the hearts of the brothers as
Finola sang, and, as she ended, once more the
chime stole across the isle. No longer did it
strike terror into the hearts of the children of
Lir, rather as a note of peace did it sink into
their souls.</p>

<p>Then, when the last chime died, Finola said,
&ldquo;Let us sing to the great King of Heaven and
Earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far stole the sweet strains of the white swans,
far across Inis Glora, until they reached the
good Saint Kemoc, for whose early prayers the
Christ-bell had chimed.</p>

<p>And he, filled with wonder at the surpassing
sweetness of the music, stood mute, but when it
was revealed unto him that the voices he heard
were the voices of Finola and Aed and Fiacra
and Conn, who thanked the High God for the
chime of the Christ-bell, he knelt and also gave
thanks, for it was to seek the children of Lir
that the saint had come to Inis Glora.</p>

<p>In the glory of noon, Kemoc reached the shore
of the little lake, and saw four white swans gliding
on its waters. And no need had the saint to
ask whether these indeed were the children of
Lir. Rather did he give thanks to the High God
who had brought him hither.</p>

<p>Then gravely the good Kemoc said to the
swans: &ldquo;Come ye now to land, and put your
trust in me, for it is in this place that ye shall
be freed from your enchantment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words the four white swans heard with
great joy, and coming to the shore they placed
themselves under the care of the saint. And he
led them to his cell, and there they dwelt with
him. And Kemoc sent to Erin for a skilful
workman, and ordered that two slender chains
of shining silver be made. Betwixt Finola and
Aed did he clasp one silver chain, and with the
other did he bind Fiacra and Conn.</p>

<p>Then did the children of Lir dwell with the
holy Kemoc, and he taught them the wonderful
story of Christ that he and Saint Patrick had
brought to the Green Isle. And the story so
gladdened their hearts that the misery of their
past sufferings was well-nigh forgotten, and they
lived in great happiness with the saint. Dear to
him were they, dear as though they had been his
own children.</p>

<p>Thrice three hundred years had gone since
Eva had chanted the fate of the children of Lir.
&ldquo;Until Decca be the Queen of Largnen, until
the good saint come to Erin, and ye hear the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
chime of the Christ-bell, shall ye not be delivered
from your doom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good saint had indeed come, and the sweet
chimes of the Christ-bell had been heard, and
the fair Decca was now the Queen of King
Largnen.</p>

<p>Soon were tidings brought to Decca of the
swan-maiden and her three swan-brothers.
Strange tales did she hear of their haunting
songs. It was told her, too, of their cruel miseries.
Then begged she her husband, the King,
that he would go to Kemoc and bring to her
these human birds.</p>

<p>But Largnen did not wish to ask Kemoc to
part with the swans, and therefore he did not
go.</p>

<p>Then was Decca angry, and swore she would
live no longer with Largnen, until he brought
the singing swans to the palace. And that same
night she set out for her father&#8217;s kingdom in the
south.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Largnen loved Decca, and great
was his grief when he heard that she had fled.
And he commanded messengers to go after her,
saying he would send for the white swans if she
would but come back. Therefore Decca returned
to the palace, and Largnen sent to Kemoc to beg
of him the four white swans. But the messenger
returned without the birds.</p>

<p>Then was Largnen wroth, and set out himself
for the cell of Kemoc. But he found the saint
in the little church, and before the altar were
the four white swans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it truly told me that you refused these
birds to Queen Decca?&rdquo; asked the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is truly told,&rdquo; replied Kemoc.</p>

<p>Then Largnen was more wroth than before,
and seizing the silver chain of Finola and Aed
in the one hand, and the chain of Fiacra and
Conn in the other, he dragged the birds from
the altar and down the aisle, and it seemed as
though he would leave the church. And in great
fear did the saint follow.</p>

<p>But lo! as they reached the door, the snow-white
feathers of the four swans fell to the
ground, and the children of Lir were delivered
from their doom. For was not Decca the bride
of Largnen, and the good saint had he not come,
and the chime of the Christ-bell was it not heard
in the land?</p>

<p>But aged and feeble were the children of Lir.
Wrinkled were their once fair faces, and bent
their little white bodies.</p>

<p>At the sight Largnen, affrighted, fled from
the church, and the good Kemoc cried aloud,
&ldquo;Woe to thee, O King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did the children of Lir turn toward the
saint, and thus Finola spake: &ldquo;Baptize us now,
we pray thee, for death is nigh. Heavy with
sorrow are our hearts that we must part from
thee, thou holy one, and that in loneliness must
thy days on earth be spent. But such is the will
of the high God. Here let our graves be digged,
and here bury our four bodies, Conn standing at
my right side, Fiacra at my left, and Aed before
my face, for thus did I shelter my dear brothers
for thrice three hundred years &#8217;neath wing and
breast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then did the good Kemoc baptize the children
of Lir, and thereafter the saint looked up, and
lo! he saw a vision of four lovely children with
silvery wings, and faces radiant as the sun; and
as he gazed they floated ever upward, until they
were lost in a mist of blue. Then was the good
Kemoc glad, for he knew that they had gone to
heaven.</p>

<p>But, when he looked downward, four worn
bodies lay at the church door, and Kemoc wept
sore.</p>

<p>And the saint ordered a wide grave to
be digged close by the little church, and there
were the children of Lir buried, Conn
standing at Finola&#8217;s right hand, and Fiacra
at her left, and before her face her twin brother
Aed.</p>

<p>And the grass grew green above them, and a
white tombstone bore their names, and across
the grave floated morning and evening the chime
of the sweet Christ-bell.</p>

<h2><a name="ANDY" id="ANDY"></a>THE MISHAPS OF HANDY ANDY</h2>


<p>Andy Rooney was a fellow who had the most
singularly ingenious knack of doing everything
the wrong way. He grew up in his humble Irish
home full of mischief to the eyes of every one
save his admiring mother. But, to do him justice,
he never meant harm in the course of his
life, and he was most anxious to offer his services
on every occasion to all who would accept
them. Here is the account of how Andy first
went into service:</p>

<p>When Andy grew up to be what in country
parlance is called &ldquo;a brave lump of a boy,&rdquo; and
his mother thought he was old enough to do
something for himself, she took him one day
along with her to the squire&#8217;s, and waited outside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the door, loitering up and down the yard
behind the house, among a crowd of beggars and
great lazy dogs that were thrusting their heads
into every iron pot that stood outside the kitchen
door, until chance might give her &ldquo;a sight of the
squire afore he wint out, or afore he wint in&rdquo;;
and, after spending her entire day in this idle
way, at last the squire made his appearance, and
Judy presented her son, who kept scraping his
foot, and pulling his forelock, that stuck out like
a piece of ragged thatch from his forehead, making
his obeisance to the squire, while his mother
was sounding his praises for being the &ldquo;handiest
craythur alive, and so willin&#8217;&mdash;nothin&#8217; comes
wrong to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose the English of all this is, you want
me to take him?&rdquo; said the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throth, an&#8217; your honor, that&#8217;s just it&mdash;if your
honor would be plazed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything, your honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means <em>nothing</em>, I suppose,&rdquo; said the
squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir! Everything, I mane, that you
would desire him to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To every one of these assurances on his
mother&#8217;s part Andy made a bow and a scrape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can he take care of horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best of care, sir,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him come, then, and help in the stables,
and we&#8217;ll see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day found Andy duly installed in the
office of stable-helper; and, as he was a good
rider, he was soon made whipper-in to the
hounds, and became a favorite with the squire,
who was one of those rollicking &ldquo;boys&rdquo; of the
old school, who let any one that chance threw
in his way bring him his boots, or his hot water
for shaving, or brush his coat, whenever it was
brushed. The squire, you see, scorned the attentions
of a regular valet. But Andy knew a
great deal more about horses than about the
duties of a valet. One morning he came to his
master&#8217;s room with hot water and tapped at the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&#8217;s that?&rdquo; said the squire, who had just
risen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy! Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s the hot water, sir,&rdquo; said Andy, bearing
an enormous tin can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what brings that enormous tin can
here? You might as well bring the stable-bucket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Andy, retreating.
In two minutes more Andy came back,
and, tapping at the door, put in his head
cautiously.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>HOW ANDY BROUGHT HIS MASTER&#8217;S<br />
HOT WATER IN THE MORNING</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The maids in the kitchen, your honor, say
there&#8217;s not so much hot water ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not see it a moment since in your
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but that&#8217;s not nigh the full o&#8217; the
stable-bucket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along, you stupid thief, and get me some
hot water directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will the can do, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, anything, so you make haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off posted Andy, and back he came with the
can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;ll I put it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw this out,&rdquo; said the squire, handing
Andy a jug containing some cold water, meaning
the jug to be replenished with the hot.</p>

<p>Andy took the jug, and the window of the
room being open, he very deliberately threw the
jug out. The squire stared with wonder, and at
last said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, you <em>towld</em> me to throw it out, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out of this, you thick-headed villain,&rdquo; said
the squire, throwing his boots at Andy&#8217;s head;
whereupon Andy retreated, and, like all stupid
people, thought himself a very ill-used person.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ANDY OPENED<br />
A BOTTLE OF SODA AT THE DINNER</strong></p>

<p>Andy was soon the laughing-stock of the household.
When, for example, he first saw silver
forks he declared that &ldquo;he had never seen a silver
spoon split that way before.&rdquo; When told to
&ldquo;cut the cord&rdquo; of a soda-water bottle on one occasion
when the squire was entertaining a number
of guests at dinner, he &ldquo;did as he was desired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He happened at that time to hold the bottle
on the level with the candles that shed light over
the festive board from a large silver branch, and
the moment he made the incision, bang went the
bottle of soda, knocking out two of the lights
with the projected cork, which struck the squire
himself in the eye at the foot of the table; while
the hostess, at the head, had a cold bath down
her back. Andy, when he saw the soda-water
jumping out of the bottle, held it from him at
arm&#8217;s length, at every fizz it made, exclaiming:
&ldquo;Ow! Ow! Ow!&rdquo; and at last, when the bottle
was empty, he roared out: &ldquo;Oh, oh, it&#8217;s all
gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great was the commotion. Few could resist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
laughter, except the ladies, who all looked at
their gowns, not liking the mixture of satin and
soda-water. The extinguished candles were relighted,
the squire got his eyes open again, and
the next time he perceived the butler sufficiently
near to speak to him, he said, in a low and hurried
tone of deep anger, while he knit his brow:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send that fellow out of the room.&rdquo; Suspended
from indoor service, Andy was not long
before he distinguished himself out of doors in
such a way as to involve his master in a coil of
trouble, and, incidentally, to retard the good fortune
that came to himself in the end.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>THE SQUIRE SENDS ANDY TO THE<br />
POST-OFFICE FOR A LETTER</strong></p>

<p>The squire said to him one day:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ride into the town and see if there&#8217;s a letter
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where to go?&rdquo; inquired his
master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the town, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you know where to go in the town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why don&#8217;t you ask, you stupid thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&#8217;d find out, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&#8217;t I often tell you to ask what you&#8217;re
to do when you don&#8217;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why don&#8217;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t like to be troublesome, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; said the squire, though he
could not help laughing at Andy&#8217;s excuse for remaining
in ignorance. &ldquo;Well, go to the post-office.
You know the post-office, I suppose?&rdquo;
continued his master in sarcastic tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; where they sell gunpowder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;re right for once,&rdquo; said the squire&mdash;for
his Majesty&#8217;s postmaster was the person who had
the privilege of dealing in the aforesaid combustible.
&ldquo;Go, then, to the post-office, and ask
for a letter for me. Remember, not gunpowder,
but a letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Andy, who got astride of his
hack, and trotted away to the post-office.</p>

<p>On arriving at the shop of the postmaster (for
that person carried on a brisk trade in groceries,
gimlets, broadcloth, and linen-drapery), Andy
presented himself at the counter, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a letther, sir, if you plaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you want it for?&rdquo; said the postmaster,
in a tone which Andy considered an aggression
upon the sacredness of private life. So
Andy, in his ignorance and pride, thought the
coolest contempt he could throw upon the prying
impertinence of the postmaster was to repeat his
question.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>ANDY HAS A VERY FOOLISH QUARREL<br />
WITH THE POSTMASTER</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a letther, sir, if you plaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who do you want it for?&rdquo; repeated the
postmaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s that to you?&rdquo; said Andy.</p>

<p>The postmaster, laughing at his simplicity, told
him he could not tell what letter to give him unless
he told him the direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The directions I got was to get a letther here&mdash;that&#8217;s
the directions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who gave you those directions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who&#8217;s your master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What consarn is that of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you stupid rascal, if you don&#8217;t tell me
his name, how can I give you a letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could give it if you liked; but you&#8217;re
fond of axin&#8217; impident questions, bekase you
think I&#8217;m simple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along out o&#8217; this! Your master must be
as great a goose as yourself, to send such a
messenger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad luck to your impidence!&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Is
it Squire Egan you dare to say goose to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Squire Egan&#8217;s your master, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Have you anything to say agin it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that I never saw you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, then, you&#8217;ll never see me agin if I
have my own consint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&#8217;t give you any letter for the squire unless
I know you&#8217;re his servant. Is there any
one in the town knows you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;It&#8217;s not every one is
as ignorant as you.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>WHY ANDY WOULD NOT PAY<br />
ELEVEN PENCE FOR A LETTER</strong></p>

<p>Just at this moment a person to whom Andy was
known entered the house, who vouched to the
postmaster that he might give Andy the squire&#8217;s
letter. &ldquo;Have you one for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the postmaster, producing one.
&ldquo;Fourpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman paid the fourpence postage
(the story, it must be remembered, belongs to
the earlier half of the last century, before the
days of the penny post), and left the shop with
his letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&#8217;s a letter for the squire,&rdquo; said the postmaster.
&ldquo;You&#8217;ve to pay me elevenpence postage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What &#8217;ud I pay elevenpence for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For postage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out wid you! Didn&#8217;t I see you give Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Durfy a letther for fourpence this minit, and
a bigger letther than this? And now you want
me to pay elevenpence for this scrap of a thing?
Do you think I&#8217;m a fool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I&#8217;m sure of it,&rdquo; said the postmaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&#8217;re welkum, to be sure; but don&#8217;t
be delayin&#8217; me now. Here&#8217;s fourpence for you,
and gi&#8217; me the letther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go along, you stupid thief!&rdquo; (the word
&ldquo;thief&rdquo; was often used in Ireland in the humorous
way we sometimes use the word &ldquo;rascal&rdquo;)
said the postmaster, taking up the letter, and
going to serve a customer with a mouse-trap.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>WHY ANDY WENT BACK TO THE<br />
SQUIRE WITHOUT HIS LETTER</strong></p>

<p>While this person and many others were served,
Andy lounged up and down the shop, every now
and then putting in his head in the middle of the
customers and saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you gi&#8217; me the letther?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited for above half an hour, and at last
left, when he found it impossible to get common
justice for his master, which he thought he deserved
as well as another man; for, under this
impression, Andy determined to give no more
than the fourpence. The squire, in the meantime,
was getting impatient for his return, and
when Andy made his appearance, asked if there
was a letter for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is, sir,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&#8217;t it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&#8217;t give it to me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&#8217;t give it to you?&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>ANDY IS SENT BACK TO THE POST-OFFICE<br />
BY HIS ANGRY MASTER</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;That owld chate beyant in the town&mdash;wanting
to charge double for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&#8217;s a double letter. Why didn&#8217;t you
pay what he asked, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah, sir, why would I let you be chated?
It&#8217;s not a double letther at all; not above half
the size o&#8217; one Mr. Durfy got before my face for
fourpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ll provoke me to break your neck some
day, you vagabond! Ride back for your life,
and pay whatever he asks, and get me the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I tell you he was sellin&#8217; them before
my face for fourpence apiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back, you scoundrel, or I&#8217;ll horsewhip
you; and if you&#8217;re longer than an hour, I&#8217;ll
have you ducked in the horsepond!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy vanished, and made a second visit to
the post-office. When he arrived two other persons
were getting letters, and the postmaster was
selecting the epistles for each from a large parcel
that lay before him on the counter. At the
same time many shop customers were waiting to
be served.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve come for that letther,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll attend to you by and by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The masther&#8217;s in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him wait till his hurry&#8217;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;ll murther me if I&#8217;m not back soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>CALLED A &ldquo;THIEF&rdquo; IN JEST, ANDY DOES<br />
A LITTLE THIEVING IN EARNEST</strong></p>

<p>While the postmaster went on with such provoking
answers to these appeals for despatch,
Andy&#8217;s eye caught the heap of letters which lay
on the counter. So, while certain weighing of
soap and tobacco was going forward, he contrived
to become possessed of two letters from
the heap, and, having effected that, waited patiently
enough until it was the great man&#8217;s pleasure
to give him the missive directed to his master.</p>

<p>Then did Andy bestride his hack, and, in triumph
at his trick on the postmaster, rattled along
the road homeward as fast as the beast could
carry him. He came into the squire&#8217;s presence;
his face beaming with delight, and an air of self-satisfied
superiority in his manner, quite unaccountable
to his master, until he pulled forth his
hand, which had been grubbing up his prizes
from the bottom of his pocket, and, holding three
letters over his head while he said: &ldquo;Look at
that!&rdquo; he next slapped them down under his
broad fist on the table before the squire, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he did make me pay elevenpence, I
brought your honor the worth o&#8217; your money,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the letter addressed to the squire was
from his law-agent, and concerned an approaching
election in the county. His old friend, Mr.
Gustavus O&#8217;Grady, the master of Neck-or-Nothing
Hall, was, it appeared, working in the interest
of the honorable Sackville Scatterbrain,
and against Squire Egan.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>THE TROUBLE THAT CAME OF ANDY&#8217;S<br />
FAMOUS VISITS TO THE POST-OFFICE</strong></p>

<p>This unexpected information threw him into a
great rage, in the midst of which his eye caught
sight of one of the letters Andy had taken from
the post-office. This was addressed to Mr.
O&#8217;Grady, and as it bore the Dublin postmark,
Mr. Egan yielded to the temptation of making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the letter gape at its extremities&mdash;this was before
the days of the envelope&mdash;and so read its contents,
which were highly uncomplimentary to the
reader. As Mr. O&#8217;Grady was much in debt
financially to Mr. Egan, the latter decided to put
all the pressure of the law upon his one-time
friend, and, to save trouble with the authorities,
destroyed both of the stolen letters and pledged
Andy to secrecy.</p>

<p>Neck-or-Nothing Hall was carefully guarded
from intruders, and Mr. Egan&#8217;s agent, Mr. Murphy,
greatly doubted if it would be possible to
serve its master with a writ. Our friend Andy,
however, unconsciously solved the difficulty.</p>

<p>Being sent over to the law-agent&#8217;s for the writ,
and at the same time bidden to call at the apothecary&#8217;s
for a prescription, he managed to mix
up the two documents, leaving the writ, without
its accompanying letter, at the apothecary&#8217;s,
whence it was duly forwarded to Neck-or-Nothing
Hall with certain medicines for Mr. O&#8217;Grady,
who was then lying ill in bed. The law-agent&#8217;s
letter, in its turn, was brought to Squire Egan
by Andy, together with a blister which was
meant for Mr. O&#8217;Grady. Imagine the recipient&#8217;s
anger when he read the following missive and,
on opening the package it was with, found a real
and not a figurative blister:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Squire</span>: I send you the blister for
O&#8217;Grady as you insist on it; but I think you won&#8217;t
find it easy to serve him with it.<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">&ldquo;Your obedient and obliged,</span><br />
                  <span style="margin-left: 10em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Murtough Murphy</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The result in his case was a hurried ride to
the law-agent&#8217;s and the administration to that
devoted personage of a severe hiding. This was
followed by a duel, in which, happily, neither
combatant was hurt. Then, after the firing,
satisfactory explanations were made. On Mr.
O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s part, there was an almost simultaneous
descent upon the unsuspecting apothecary,
and the administration to the man of drugs and
blisters of a terrible drubbing. Next a duel was
arranged between the two old friends. Andy
again distinguished himself.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>HOW ANDY WAS FINALLY DISCHARGED<br />
FROM THE SERVICE OF SQUIRE EGAN</strong></p>

<p>When his employer&#8217;s second was not looking,
Andy thought he would do Squire Egan a good
turn by inserting bullets in his pistols before they
were loaded. The intention of Andy was to
give Mr. Egan the advantage of double bullets,
but the result was that, when the weapons were
loaded, Andy&#8217;s bullets lay between the powder
and the touch-hole. Mr. O&#8217;Grady missed his
aim twice, and Mr. Egan missed his fire. The
cause being discovered, Andy was unmercifully
chased and punished by the second, and ignominiously
dismissed from Mr. Egan&#8217;s service.</p>

<p>By an accident, Andy shortly afterward was
the means of driving a Mr. Furlong to Squire
Egan&#8217;s place instead of to Squire O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s.
Mr. Furlong was an agent from Dublin Castle,
whose commission it was to aid the cause of the
Honorable Mr. Scatterbrain. Of course, Andy,
when he was told, on taking the place of the
driver of the vehicle in which Mr. Furlong was
traveling, to drive this important personage to
&ldquo;the squire&#8217;s,&rdquo; at once jumped to the conclusion
that by &ldquo;the squire&#8217;s&rdquo; was meant Mr. Egan&#8217;s.
Here, before the mistake was found out by the
victim, Mr. Furlong was unburdened of much
important information. While this process was
going on at Mr. Egan&#8217;s, a hue and cry was on
foot at Mr. O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s, for the lost Mr. Furlong,
and poor, blundering Andy was arrested and
charged with murdering him.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>ANOTHER OF ANDY&#8217;S BLUNDERS HAS<br />
A HAPPY RESULT FOR HIS OLD MASTER</strong></p>

<p>He was soon set free and taken into Mr.
O&#8217;Grady&#8217;s service when Mr. Furlong had made
his appearance before the owner of Neck-or-Nothing
Hall. But a clever rascal named Larry
Hogan divined by accident and the help of his
native wit the secret of the stolen letters, and
Andy was forced by terror to flee from Neck-or-Nothing
Hall.</p>

<p>His subsequent adventures took him through
the heat of the election, at which his ingenuity
was displayed in unwittingly stopping up the
mouth of the trumpet on which the Honorable
Mr. Scatterbrain&#8217;s supporters relied to drown
Mr. Egan&#8217;s speeches and those of his men. He
thus did a good turn to his old master without
knowing it, having merely imitated the action
of the trumpeter, who had pretended to cork up
the instrument before momentarily laying it
aside.</p>

<p>When his fortunes seemed to be at their lowest
ebb, Andy was discovered to be the rightful heir
to the Scatterbrain title and estates, his claims to
which were set forth in the second of the two
letters stolen from the post-office, which had been
destroyed by the squire without his reading it.</p>


<p class="center">
<strong>ANDY TURNS OUT TO BE OF GENTLE<br />
BIRTH AND COMES INTO HIS OWN</strong></p>

<p>Soon afterward, through his old master&#8217;s influence,
Andy was taken to London, and by dint of
much effort remedied many of the defects of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
early education. Then, marrying his cousin,
Onoah, who had shared his mother&#8217;s cabin in the
old days, and to save whom from a desperado
Andy had, this time knowingly, braved great
personal danger, our hero settled down to the
enjoyment of a life such as he had never
dreamed of in his humble days.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="GREEDY" id="GREEDY"></a>THE GREEDY SHEPHERD</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in the South Country
two brothers, whose business it was to keep
sheep. No one lived on that plain but shepherds,
who watched their sheep so carefully that no
lamb was ever lost.</p>

<p>There was none among them more careful
than these two brothers, one of whom was called
Clutch, and the other Kind. Though brothers,
no two men could be more unlike in disposition.
Clutch thought of nothing but how to make some
profit for himself, while Kind would have shared
his last morsel with a hungry dog. This covetous
mind made Clutch keep all his father&#8217;s sheep
when the old man was dead, because he was the
eldest brother, allowing Kind nothing but the
place of a servant to help him in looking after
them.</p>

<p>For some time the brothers lived peaceably in
their father&#8217;s cottage, and kept their flock on the
grassy plain, till new troubles arose through
Clutch&#8217;s covetousness.</p>

<p>One midsummer it so happened that the traders
praised the wool of Clutch&#8217;s flock more than
all they found on the plain, and gave him the
highest price for it. That was an unlucky thing
for the sheep, for after that Clutch thought he
could never get enough wool off them. At shearing
time nobody clipped so close as Clutch, and,
in spite of all Kind could do or say, he left the
poor sheep as bare as if they had been shaven.
Kind didn&#8217;t like these doings, but Clutch always
tried to persuade him that close clipping was
good for the sheep, and Kind always tried to
make him think he had got all the wool. Still
Clutch sold the wool, and stored up his profits,
and one midsummer after another passed. The
shepherds began to think him a rich man, and
close clipping might have become the fashion but
for a strange thing which happened to his flock.</p>

<p>The wool had grown well that summer. He
had taken two crops off the sheep, and was thinking
of a third, when first the lambs, and then
the ewes, began to stray away; and, search as
the brothers would, none of them was ever found
again. The flocks grew smaller every day, and
all the brothers could find out was that the closest
clipped were the first to go.</p>

<p>Kind grew tired of watching, and Clutch lost
his sleep with vexation. The other shepherds,
to whom he had boasted of his wool and his
profits, were not sorry to see pride having a
fall. Still the flock melted away as the months
wore on, and when the spring came back nothing
remained with Clutch and Kind but three old
ewes. The two brothers were watching these
ewes one evening when Clutch said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, there is wool to be had on their
backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too little to keep them warm,&rdquo; said Kind.
&ldquo;The east wind still blows sometimes.&rdquo; But
Clutch was off to the cottage for the bag and
shears.</p>

<p>Kind was grieved to see his brother so covetous,
and to divert his mind he looked up at the
great hills. As he looked, three creatures like
sheep scoured up a cleft in one of the hills, as
fleet as any deer; and when Kind turned he saw
his brother coming with the bag and shears, but
not a single ewe was to be seen. Clutch&#8217;s first
question was, what had become of them; and
when Kind told him what he saw, the eldest
brother scolded him for not watching better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we have not a single sheep,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and the other shepherds will hardly give us
room among them at shearing time or harvest.
If you like to come with me, we shall get service
somewhere. I have heard my father say that
there were great shepherds living in old times
beyond the hills; let us go and see if they will
take us for sheep-boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, next morning Clutch took his bag
and shears, Kind took his crook and pipe, and
away they went over the plain and up the hills.
All who saw them thought that they had lost
their senses, for no shepherd had gone there for
a hundred years, and nothing was to be seen but
wide moorlands, full of rugged rocks, and sloping
up, it seemed, to the very sky.</p>

<p>By noon they came to the stony cleft up which
the three old ewes had scoured like deer; but
both were tired, and sat down to rest. As they
sat there, there came a sound of music down the
hills as if a thousand shepherds had been playing
on their pipes. Clutch and Kind had never
heard such music before, and, getting up, they
followed the sound up the cleft, and over a wide
heath, till at sunset they came to the hill-top,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
where they saw a flock of thousands of snow-white
sheep feeding, while an old man sat in the
midst of them playing merrily on his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good father,&rdquo; said Kind, for his eldest
brother hung back and was afraid, &ldquo;tell us what
land is this, and where we can find service; for
my brother and I are shepherds, and can keep
flocks from straying, though we have lost our
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the hill pastures,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;and I am the ancient shepherd. My flocks never
stray, but I have employment for you. Which of
you can shear best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good father,&rdquo; said Clutch, taking courage, &ldquo;I
am the closest shearer in all the plain country;
you would not find enough wool to make a thread
on a sheep when I have done with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the man for my business,&rdquo; said the
old shepherd. &ldquo;When the moon rises, I will call
the flock you have to shear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun went down and the moon rose, and all
the snow-white sheep laid themselves down behind
him. Then up the hills came a troop of
shaggy wolves, with hair so long that their eyes
could scarcely be seen. Clutch would have fled
for fear, but the wolves stopped, and the old
man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rise and shear&mdash;this flock of mine have too
much wool on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clutch had never shorn wolves before, yet he
went forward bravely; but the first of the wolves
showed its teeth, and all the rest raised such a
howl that Clutch was glad to throw down his
shears and run behind the old man for safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good father,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I will shear sheep,
but not wolves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be shorn,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;or
you go back to the plains, and them after you;
but whichever of you can shear them will get
the whole flock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On hearing this, Kind caught up the shears
Clutch had thrown away in his fright, and went
boldly up to the nearest wolf. To his great surprise,
the wild creature seemed to know him, and
stood quietly to be shorn. Kind clipped neatly,
but not too closely, and when he had done with
one, another came forward, till the whole flock
were shorn. Then the man said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well; take the wool and the
flock for your wages, return with them to the
plain, and take this brother of yours for a boy
to keep them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kind did not much like keeping wolves, but before
he could answer they had all changed into
the very sheep which had strayed away, and the
hair he had cut off was now a heap of fine and
soft wool.</p>

<p>Clutch gathered it up in his bag, and went back
to the plain with his brother. They keep the
sheep together till this day, but Clutch has grown
less greedy, and Kind alone uses the shears.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CUCKOO" id="CUCKOO"></a>THE COBBLERS AND THE CUCKOO</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there stood in the midst of a
bleak moor, in the North Country, a certain village;
all its inhabitants were poor, for their
fields were barren, and they had little trade. But
the poorest of them all were two brothers called
Scrub and Spare, who followed the cobbler&#8217;s
craft, and had but one stall between them. It
was a hut built of clay and wattles. There they
worked in most brotherly friendship, though with
little encouragement.</p>

<p>The people of that village were not extravagant
in shoes, and better cobblers than Scrub and
Spare might be found. Nevertheless, Scrub and
Spare managed to live between their own trade,
a small barley-field, and a cottage-garden, till
one unlucky day when a new cobbler arrived in
the village. He had lived in the capital city of
the kingdom, and, by his own account, cobbled
for the queen and the princesses. His awls were
sharp, his lasts were new; he set up his stall in
a neat cottage with two windows.</p>

<p>The villagers soon found out that one patch of
his would outwear two of the brothers&#8217;. In short,
all the mending left Scrub and Spare, and went
to the new cobbler. So the brothers were poor
that winter, and when Christmas came they had
nothing to feast on but a barley loaf, a piece of
musty bacon, and some small beer of their own
brewing. But they made a great fire of logs,
which crackled and blazed with red embers, and
in high glee the cobblers sat down to their beer
and bacon. The door was shut, for there was
nothing but cold moonlight and snow outside;
but the hut, strewn with fir boughs, and ornamented
with holly, looked cheerful as the ruddy
blaze flared up and rejoiced their hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long life and good fortune to ourselves,
brother!&rdquo; said Spare. &ldquo;I hope you will drink
that toast, and may we never have a worse fire
on Christmas&mdash;but what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spare set down the drinking-horn, and the
brothers listened astonished, for out of the blazing
root they heard &ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; as plain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
as ever the spring bird&#8217;s voice came over the
moor on a May morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is something bad,&rdquo; said Scrub, terribly
frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May be not,&rdquo; said Spare.</p>

<p>And out of the deep hole at the side which
the fire had not reached flew a large gray cuckoo,
and lit on the table before them. Much as the
cobblers had been surprised, they were still more
so when the bird began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gentlemen,&rdquo; it said slowly, &ldquo;can you
tell me what season this is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s Christmas,&rdquo; answered Spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then a merry Christmas to you!&rdquo; said the
cuckoo. &ldquo;I went to sleep in the hollow of that
old root one evening last summer, and never
woke till the heat of your fire made me think it
was summer again; but now, since you have
burned my lodging, let me stay in your hut till
the spring comes round&mdash;I only want a hole to
sleep in&mdash;and when I go on my travels next summer
be assured that I will bring you some present
for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, and welcome,&rdquo; said Spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll make you a good warm hole in the
thatch. But you must be hungry after that long
sleep. Here is a slice of barley bread. Come,
help us to keep Christmas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cuckoo ate up the slice, drank water from
the brown jug&mdash;for he would take no beer&mdash;and
flew into a snug hole which Spare scooped for
him in the thatch of the hut. So the snow melted,
the heavy rains came, the cold grew less, the
days lengthened, and one sunny morning the
brothers were awakened by the cuckoo shouting
its own cry to let them know that at last the
spring had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the bird, &ldquo;I am going on my travels
over the world to tell men of the spring.
There is no country where trees bud or flowers
bloom that I will not cry in before the year goes
round. Give me another slice of barley bread
to keep me on my journey, and tell me what present
I shall bring you at the end of the twelve
months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Master Cuckoo,&rdquo; said Scrub, &ldquo;a diamond
or pearl would help such poor men as my
brother and I to provide something better than
barley bread for your next entertainment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of diamonds or pearls,&rdquo; said
the cuckoo; &ldquo;they are in the hearts of rocks and
the sands of rivers. My knowledge is only of
that which grows on the earth. But there are
two trees hard by the well that lies at the world&#8217;s
end. One of them is called the golden tree, for
its leaves are all of beaten gold. As for the
other, it is always green, like a laurel. Some
call it the wise, and some the merry tree. Its
leaves never fall, but they that get one of them
keep a blithe heart in spite of all misfortunes,
and can make themselves as merry in a poor hut
as in a handsome palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Master Cuckoo, bring me a leaf off that
tree!&rdquo; cried Spare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, brother, don&#8217;t be foolish!&rdquo; said Scrub.
&ldquo;Think of the leaves of beaten gold! Dear Master
Cuckoo, bring me one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before another word could be spoken, the
cuckoo had flown.</p>

<p>The brothers were poorer than ever that year;
nobody would send them a single shoe to mend.
The new cobbler said, in scorn, they should come
to be his apprentices; and Scrub and Spare would
have left the village but for their barley field,
their cabbage garden, and a maid called Fairfeather,
whom both the cobblers had courted for
more than seven years.</p>

<p>At the end of the winter Scrub and Spare had
grown so poor and ragged that Fairfeather
thought them beneath her notice. Old neighbors
forgot to invite them to wedding feasts or merry-makings;
and they thought the cuckoo had forgotten
them, too, when at daybreak, on the first
of April, they heard a hard beak knocking at
their door, and a voice crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo! Let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spare ran to open the door, and in came the
cuckoo, carrying on one side of his bill a golden
leaf, larger than that of any tree in the North
Country; and in the other, one like that of the
common laurel, only it had a fresher green.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; it said, giving the gold to Scrub and
the green to Spare.</p>

<p>So much gold had never been in the cobbler&#8217;s
hands before, and he could not help exulting
over his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See the wisdom of my choice,&rdquo; he said, holding
up the large leaf of gold. &ldquo;As for yours, as
good might be plucked from any hedge. I wonder
a sensible bird should carry the like so far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Master Cobbler,&rdquo; cried the cuckoo, finishing
the slice, &ldquo;your conclusions are more hasty
than courteous. If your brother be disappointed
this time, I go on the same journey every year,
and, for your hospitable entertainment, will think
it no trouble to bring each of you whichever leaf
you desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darling cuckoo,&rdquo; cried Scrub, &ldquo;bring me a
golden one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Spare, looking up from the green leaf on
which he gazed, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure to bring me one from the merry tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And away flew the cuckoo once again.</p>

<p>Scrub vowed that his brother was not fit to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
live with a respectable man; and taking his lasts,
his awls, and his golden leaf, he left the wattle
hut, and went to tell the villagers.</p>

<p>They were astonished at the folly of Spare,
and charmed with Scrub&#8217;s good sense, particularly
when he showed them the golden leaf, and
told them that the cuckoo would bring him one
every spring. The new cobbler immediately took
him into partnership; the greatest people sent
him their shoes to mend; Fairfeather smiled graciously
upon him, and in the course of that summer
they were married, with a grand wedding
feast, at which the whole village danced, except
Spare, who was not invited.</p>

<p>As for Scrub, he established himself with Fairfeather
in a cottage close by that of the new
cobbler, and quite as fine. There he mended
shoes to everybody&#8217;s satisfaction, had a scarlet
coat for holidays, and a fat goose for dinner
every wedding-day anniversary. Spare lived on
in the old hut and worked in the cabbage garden.
Every day his coat grew more ragged, and the
hut more weather-beaten; but people remarked
that he never looked sad or sour; and the wonder
was that, from the time they began to keep
his company the tinker grew kinder to the poor
ass with which he traveled the country, the beggar-boy
kept out of mischief, and the old woman
was never cross to her cat or angry with the
children.</p>

<p>I know not how many years passed in this
manner, when a certain great lord, who owned
that village, came to the neighborhood. His castle
was ancient and strong, with high towers and
a deep moat. All the country, as far as one could
see from the highest turret, belonged to this
lord; but he had not been there for twenty years,
and would not have come then, only he was melancholy.</p>

<p>The cause of his grief and sorrow was that
he had been prime minister at court, and in
high favor, till somebody told the Crown Prince
that he had spoken disrespectfully concerning
the turning out of his Royal Highness&#8217;s toes,
whereon the North Country lord was turned out
of office, and banished to his own estate. There
he lived for some weeks in very bad temper; but
one day in the harvest time his lordship chanced
to meet Spare gathering watercresses at a
meadow stream, and fell into talk.</p>

<p>How it was nobody could tell, but from the
hour of that discourse the great lord cast away
his melancholy, and went about with a noble
train, making merry in his hall, where all travelers
were entertained and all the poor were
welcome.</p>

<p>This strange story soon spread through the
North Country, and a great company came to the
cobbler&#8217;s hut&mdash;rich men who had lost their
money, poor men who had lost their friends,
beauties who had grown old, wits who had gone
out of fashion&mdash;all came to talk with Spare, and,
whatever their troubles, all went home merry.
The rich gave him presents, the poor gave him
thanks.</p>

<p>By this time his fame had reached the Court.
There were a great many discontented people
there besides the King, who had lately fallen into
ill humor because a neighboring princess, with
seven islands for her dowry, would not marry
his eldest son. So a royal messenger was sent
to Spare, with a command that he should go to
court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow is the first of April,&rdquo; said Spare,
&ldquo;and I will go with you two hours after sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The messenger lodged all night at the castle,
and the cuckoo came at sunrise with the merry
leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Court is a fine place,&rdquo; he said, when the cobbler
told him he was going; &ldquo;but I cannot go
there&mdash;they would lay snares and catch me. So
be careful of the leaves I have brought you, and
give me a farewell slice of barley bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spare was sorry to part with the cuckoo, but
he gave him a thick slice, and, having sewed up
the leaves in the lining of his leather doublet, he
set out with the messenger on his way to the
royal court.</p>

<p>His coming caused great surprise; but scarce
had his Majesty conversed with him half an hour
when the princess and her seven islands were
forgotten, and orders given that a feast for all
comers should be spread in the banquet-hall.
The princes of the blood, the great lords and
ladies, ministers of state, and judges of the land,
after that discoursed with Spare, and the more
they talked the lighter grew their hearts, so that
such changes had never been seen.</p>

<p>As for Spare, he had a chamber assigned him
in the palace, and a seat at the King&#8217;s table; one
sent him rich robes and another costly jewels;
but in the midst of all his grandeur he still wore
the leathern doublet, which the palace servants
thought remarkably mean. One day the King&#8217;s
attention being drawn to it by the chief page, his
Majesty inquired why Spare didn&#8217;t give it to a
beggar. But the cobbler said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;High and mighty monarch, this doublet was
with me before silk and velvet came&mdash;I find it
easier to wear than the court cut; moreover, it
serves to keep me humble, by recalling the days
when it was my holiday garment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The King thought this a wise speech, and commanded
that no one should find fault with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
leathern doublet. So things went, and Spare
prospered at court until the day when he lost his
doublet, of which we read in the next story.</p>

<h2><a name="COAT" id="COAT"></a>THE MERRY COBBLER AND HIS COAT</h2>


<p>Spare, the merry cobbler, of whom we read in
the last story, was treated like a prince at the
King&#8217;s court; and the news of his good fortune
reached his brother Scrub in the moorland cottage
one first of April, when the cuckoo came
again with two golden leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of that!&rdquo; said Fairfeather. &ldquo;Here we
are spending our lives in this humdrum place,
and Spare making his fortune at court with two
or three paltry green leaves! What would they
say to our golden ones? Let us make our way
to the King&#8217;s palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrub thought this excellent reasoning. So,
putting on their holiday clothes, Fairfeather took
her looking-glass and Scrub his drinking-horn,
which happened to have a very thin rim of silver,
and, each carrying a golden leaf carefully
wrapped up that none might see it till they
reached the palace, the pair set out in great expectation.</p>

<p>How far Scrub and Fairfeather journeyed
we cannot say, but when the sun was high and
warm at noon they came into a wood feeling both
tired and hungry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us rest ourselves under this tree,&rdquo; said
Fairfeather, &ldquo;and look at our golden leaves to
see if they are quite safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In looking at the leaves, and talking of their
fine prospects, Scrub and Fairfeather did not perceive
that a very thin old woman had slipped
from behind the tree, with a long staff in her
hand and a great wallet by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble lord and lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will ye condescend
to tell me where I may find some water
to mix a bottle of mead which I carry in my
wallet, because it is too strong for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the old woman spoke, she pulled out a large
wooden bottle such as shepherds used in the ancient
times, corked with leaves rolled together,
and having a small wooden cup hanging from
its handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps ye will do me the favor to taste,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It is only made of the best honey. I
have also cream cheese and a wheaten loaf here,
if such honorable persons as you would not think
it beneath you to eat the like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrub and Fairfeather became very condescending
after this speech. They were now sure that
there must be some appearance of nobility about
them; besides, they were very hungry, and, having
hastily wrapped up the golden leaves, they
assured the old woman they were not at all
proud, notwithstanding the lands and castles they
had left behind them in the North Country, and
would willingly help to lighten the wallet.</p>

<p>The old woman was a wood-witch; her name
was Buttertongue; and all her time was spent in
making mead, which, being boiled with curious
herbs and spells, had the power of making all
who drank it fall asleep and dream with their
eyes open. She had two dwarfs of sons; one
was named Spy, and the other Pounce. Wherever
their mother went, they were not far behind;
and whoever tasted her mead was sure to
be robbed by the dwarfs.</p>

<p>Scrub and Fairfeather sat leaning against the
old tree. The cobbler had a lump of cheese in
his hand; his wife held fast a hunch of bread.
Their eyes and mouths were both open, but they
were dreaming of great grandeur at court, when
the old woman raised her shrill voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho, my sons! Come here, and carry
home the harvest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had she spoken than the two little
dwarfs darted out of the neighboring thicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idle boys!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;What have
ye done to-day to help our living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been to the city,&rdquo; said Spy, &ldquo;and could
see nothing. These are hard times for us&mdash;everybody
minds his business so contentedly since that
cobbler came. But here is a leathern doublet
which his page threw out of the window; it&#8217;s
of no use, but I brought it to let you see I was
not idle.&rdquo; And he tossed down Spare&#8217;s doublet,
with the merry leaves in it, which he had been
carrying like a bundle on his little back.</p>

<p>To explain how Spy came by it, it must be said
that the forest was not far from the great city
where Spare lived in such high esteem. All
things had gone well with the cobbler till the
King thought that it was quite unbecoming to see
such a worthy man without a servant. His Majesty
therefore appointed one of his own pages to
wait upon him. The name of this youth was
Tinseltoes, and nobody in all the court had
grander notions. Nothing could please him that
had not gold or silver about it, and his grandmother
feared he would hang himself for being
appointed page to a cobbler. As for Spare, the
honest man had been so used to serve himself
that the page was always in the way, but his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
merry leaves came to his assistance.</p>

<p>Tinseltoes took wonderfully to the new service.
Some said it was because Spare gave him
nothing to do but play at bowls all day on the
palace green. Yet one thing grieved the heart
of Tinseltoes, and that was his master&#8217;s leathern
doublet, and at last, finding nothing better would
do, the page got up one fine morning earlier than
his master, and tossed the leathern doublet out
of the window into a lane, where Spy found it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That nasty thing!&rdquo; said the old woman.
&ldquo;Where is the good in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Pounce had taken everything of
value from Scrub and Fairfeather&mdash;the looking-glass,
the silver-rimmed horn, the husband&#8217;s
scarlet coat, the wife&#8217;s gay mantle, and, above
all, the golden leaves, which so rejoiced old Buttertongue
and her sons that they threw the
leathern doublet over the sleeping cobbler for a
jest, and went off to their hut in the heart of the
forest.</p>

<p>The sun was going down when Scrub and
Fairfeather awoke from dreaming that they had
been made a lord and a lady, and sat clothed in
silk and velvet, feasting with the King in his
palace hall. It was a great disappointment to
find their golden leaves and all their best things
gone. Scrub tore his hair, and vowed to take the
old woman&#8217;s life; while Fairfeather lamented
sore. But Scrub, feeling cold for want of his
coat, put on the leathern doublet without asking
whence it came.</p>

<p>Scarcely was it buttoned on when a change
came over him. He addressed such merry discourse
to Fairfeather that, instead of lamentations,
she made the wood ring with laughter.
Both busied themselves in setting up a hut of
boughs, in which Scrub kindled a fire with a flint
of steel, which, together with his pipe, he had
brought unknown to Fairfeather, who had told
him the like was never heard of at court. Then
they found a pheasant&#8217;s nest at the root of an old
oak, made a meal of roasted eggs, and went to
sleep on a heap of long green grass which they
had gathered, with nightingales singing all night
long in the old trees about them.</p>

<p>In the meantime Spare had got up and missed
his doublet. Tinseltoes, of course, said he knew
nothing about it. The whole palace was
searched, and every servant questioned, till all
the court wondered why such a fuss was made
about an old leathern doublet. That very day
things came back to their old fashion. Quarrels
began among the lords, and jealousies among the
ladies. The King said his subjects did not pay
him half enough taxes, the Queen wanted more
jewels, the servants took to their old bickerings
and got up some new ones. Spare found himself
getting wonderfully dull, and very much out of
place, and nobles began to ask what business a
cobbler had at the King&#8217;s table; till at last his
Majesty issued a decree banishing the cobbler
forever from court, and confiscating all his goods
in favor of Tinseltoes.</p>

<p>That royal edict was scarcely published before
the page was in full possession of his rich chamber,
his costly garments, and all the presents the
courtiers had given him; while Spare was glad
to make his escape out of the back window, for
fear of the angry people.</p>

<p>The window from which Spare let himself
down with a strong rope was that from which
Tinseltoes had tossed the doublet, and as the
cobbler came down late in the twilight, a poor
woodman, with a heavy load of fagots, stopped
and stared in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter, friend?&rdquo; said Spare. &ldquo;Did
you never see a man coming down from a back
window before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the woodman, &ldquo;the last morning
I passed here a leathern doublet came out of that
window, and I&#8217;ll be bound you are the owner of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am, friend,&rdquo; said the cobbler with great
eagerness. &ldquo;Can you tell me which way that
doublet went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I walked on,&rdquo; the woodman said, &ldquo;a dwarf
called Spy, bundled it up and ran off into the
forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Determined to find his doublet, Spare went on
his way, and was soon among the tall trees; but
neither hut nor dwarf could he see. At last the
red light of a fire, gleaming through a thicket,
led him to the door of a low hut. It stood half
open, as if there was nothing to fear, and within
he saw his brother Scrub snoring loudly on a
bed of grass, at the foot of which lay his own
leathern doublet; while Fairfeather, in a kirtle
made of plaited rushes, sat roasting pheasants&#8217;
eggs by the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, mistress!&rdquo; said Spare.</p>

<p>The blaze shone on him, but so changed was
her brother-in-law with his court life that Fairfeather
did not know him, and she answered far
more courteously than was her wont.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, master! Whence come ye so
late? But speak low, for my good man has
sorely tired himself cleaving wood, and is taking
a sleep, as you see, before supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good rest to him,&rdquo; said Spare, perceiving he
was not known. &ldquo;I come from the court for a
day&#8217;s hunting, and have lost my way in the
forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down and have a share of our supper,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
said Fairfeather; &ldquo;I will put some more eggs in
the ashes; and tell me the news of court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you never go there?&rdquo; said the cobbler.
&ldquo;So fair a dame as you would make the ladies
marvel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are pleased to flatter,&rdquo; said Fairfeather;
&ldquo;but my husband has a brother there, and we
left our moorland village to try our fortune also.
An old woman enticed us with fair words and
strong drink at the entrance of this forest, where
we fell asleep and dreamt of great things; but
when we woke everything had been robbed from
us, and, in place of all, the robbers left him that
old leathern doublet, which he has worn ever
since, and never was so merry in all his life,
though we live in this poor hut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shabby doublet, that,&rdquo; said Spare, taking
up the garment, and seeing that it was his
own, for the merry leaves were still sewed in
its lining. &ldquo;It would be good for hunting in,
however. Your husband would be glad to part
with it, I dare say, in exchange for this handsome
cloak.&rdquo; And he pulled off the green mantle
and buttoned on the doublet, much to Fairfeather&#8217;s
delight, for she shook Scrub, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband, husband, rise and see what a good
bargain I have made!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrub rubbed his eyes, gazed up at his brother,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare, is that really you? How did you like
the court, and have you made your fortune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have, brother,&rdquo; said Spare, &ldquo;in getting
back my own good leathern doublet. Come, let us
eat eggs, and rest ourselves here this night. In
the morning we will return to our own old hut,
at the end of the moorland village, where the
Christmas cuckoo will come and bring us leaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scrub and Fairfeather agreed. So in the morning
they all returned, and found the old hut little
the worse for wear and weather. The neighbors
came about them to ask the news of court,
and see if they had made their fortune. Everybody
was astonished to find the three poorer than ever,
but somehow they liked to be back to the hut.
Spare brought out the lasts and awls he had hidden
in a corner; Scrub and he began their old
trade, and the whole North Country found out
that there never were such cobblers. Everybody
wondered why the brothers had not been more
appreciated before they went away to the court
of the King, but, from the highest to the lowest,
all were glad to have Spare and Scrub back
again.</p>

<p>They mended the shoes of lords and ladies as
well as the common people; everybody was satisfied.
Their custom increased from day to day,
and all that were disappointed, discontented, or
unlucky, came to the hut as in old times, before
Spare went to court.</p>

<p>The hut itself changed, no one knew how.
Flowering honeysuckle grew over its roof; red
and white roses grew thick about its door. Moreover,
the Christmas cuckoo always came on the
first of April, bringing three leaves of the merry
tree&mdash;for Scrub and Fairfeather would have no
more golden ones. So it was with them when
the last news came from the North Country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARITY" id="CHARITY"></a>THE STORY OF CHILD CHARITY</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY FRANCES BROWNE</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a little girl who
had neither father nor mother: they both died
when she was very young, and left their daughter
to the care of her uncle, who was the richest
farmer in all that country. He had houses and
lands, flocks and herds, many servants to work
about his house and fields, a wife who had brought
him a great dowry, and two fair daughters.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that though she was their
near relation, they despised the orphan girl, partly
because she had no fortune, and partly because
of her humble, kindly disposition. It was said
that the more needy and despised any creature
was, the more ready was she to befriend it; on
which account the people of the West Country
called her Child Charity. Her uncle would not
own her for his niece, her cousins would not keep
her company, and her aunt sent her to work in
the dairy, and to sleep in the back garret. All
the day she scoured pails, scrubbed dishes, and
washed crockery-ware; but every night she slept
in the back garret as sound as a princess could
sleep in her palace.</p>

<p>One day during the harvest season, when this
rich farmer&#8217;s corn had been all cut down and
housed, he invited the neighbors to a harvest
supper. The West Country people came in their
holiday clothes, and they were making merry,
when a poor old woman came to the back door,
begging for broken victuals and a night&#8217;s lodging.
Her clothes were coarse and ragged; her hair was
scanty and gray; her back was bent; her teeth
were gone. In short she was the poorest and
ugliest old woman that ever came begging. The
first who saw her was the kitchen-maid, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
ordered her off; but Child Charity, hearing the
noise, came out from her seat at the foot of the
lowest table, and asked the old woman to take
her share of the supper, and sleep that night in
her bed in the back garret. The old woman sat
down without a word of thanks. Child Charity
scraped the pots for her supper that night, and
slept on a sack among the lumber, while the old
woman rested in her warm bed; and next morning,
before the little girl awoke, she was up and
gone, without so much as saying thank you.</p>

<p>Next day, at supper-time, who should come to
the back door but the old woman, again asking
for broken victuals and a night&#8217;s lodging. No one
would listen to her, till Child Charity rose from
her seat and kindly asked her to take her supper,
and sleep in her bed. Again the old woman sat
down without a word. Child Charity scraped
the pots for her supper, and slept on the sack.
In the morning the old woman was gone; but for
six nights after, as sure as the supper was spread,
there was she at the door, and the little girl
regularly asked her in.</p>

<p>Sometimes the old woman said, &ldquo;Child, why
don&#8217;t you make this bed softer? and why are
your blankets so thin?&rdquo; But she never gave her
a word of thanks nor a civil good-morning. At
last, on the ninth night from her first coming,
her accustomed knock came to the door, and there
she stood with an ugly dog that no herd-boy
would keep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, my little girl,&rdquo; she said, when
Child Charity opened the door. &ldquo;I will not have
your supper and bed to-night&mdash;I am going on a
long journey to see a friend; but here is a dog
of mine, whom nobody in all the West Country
will keep for me. He is a little cross, and not
very handsome; but I leave him to your care till
the shortest day in all the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the old woman had said the last word,
she set off with such speed that Child Charity
lost sight of her in a minute. The ugly dog
began to fawn upon her, but he snarled at everybody
else. It was with great trouble that Child
Charity got leave to keep him in an old ruined
cow-house. The little girl gave him part of all
her meals; and when the hard frost came, took
him to her own back garret, because the cow-house
was damp and cold in the long nights.
The dog lay quietly on some straw in a corner.
Child Charity slept soundly, but every morning
the servants said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What great light and fine talking was that
in your back garret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no light but the moon shining
in through the shutterless window, and no talk
that I heard,&rdquo; said Child Charity, and she thought
they must have been dreaming. But night after
night, when any of them awoke in the dark,
they saw a light brighter and clearer than the
Christmas fire, and heard voices like those of
lords and ladies in the back garret.</p>

<p>At length, when the nights were longest, the
little parlor-maid crept out of bed when all the
rest were sleeping, and set herself to watch at
the keyhole. She saw the dog lying quietly in
the corner, Child Charity sleeping soundly in her
bed, and the moon shining through the shutterless
window; but an hour before daybreak the window
opened, and in marched a troop of little men
clothed in crimson and gold. They marched up
with great reverence to the dog, where he lay
on the straw, and the most richly clothed among
them said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Royal Prince, we have prepared the banquet
hall. What will your Highness please that we
do next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; said the dog. &ldquo;Now
prepare the feast, and see that all things are in
the best style, for the Princess and I mean to
bring a stranger, who never feasted in our halls
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&#8217;s commands shall be obeyed,&rdquo;
said the little man, making another reverence;
and he and his company passed out of the window.
By-and-by there came in a company of
little ladies clad in rose-colored velvet, and each
carrying a crystal lamp. They also walked with
great reverence up to the dog, and the gayest
among them said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Royal Prince, we have prepared the tapestry.
What will your Highness please that we do
next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; said the dog. &ldquo;Now
prepare the robes, and let all things be in the
first fashion, for the Princess and I will bring
with us a stranger, who never feasted in our
halls before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&#8217;s commands shall be obeyed,&rdquo;
said the little lady, making a low curtsey; and
she and her company passed out through the
window, which closed quietly behind them. The
dog stretched himself out upon the straw, the
little girl turned in her sleep, and the moon
shone in on the back garret. The parlor-maid
was much amazed, and told the story to her mistress;
but her mistress called her a silly girl to
have such foolish dreams, and scolded her.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Child Charity&#8217;s aunt thought
there might be something in it worth knowing;
so next night, when all the house was asleep she
crept out of bed, and watched at the back garret
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
door. There she saw exactly what the maid had
told her.</p>

<p>The mistress could not close her eyes any more
than the maid, from eagerness to tell the story.
She woke up Child Charity&#8217;s rich uncle before
daybreak; but when he heard it he laughed at
her for a foolish woman. But that night the
master thought he would like to see what went
on in the back garret; so when all the house was
asleep he set himself to watch at the crevice in
the door. The same thing happened that the
maid and the mistress saw.</p>

<p>The master could not close his eyes any more
than the maid or the mistress for thinking of
this strange sight. He remembered having heard
his grandfather say that somewhere near his
meadows there lay a path, which led to the
fairies&#8217; country, and he concluded that the doings
in his back garret must be fairy business, and the
ugly dog a person of very great account.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he made it his first business that
morning to get ready a fine breakfast of roast
mutton for the ugly dog, and carry it to him in
the old cow-house; but not a morsel would the
dog taste. On the contrary, he snarled at the
master, and would have bitten him if he had not
run away with his mutton.</p>

<p>Just as the family were sitting down to supper
that night, the ugly dog began to bark, and the
old woman&#8217;s knock was heard at the back door.
Child Charity opened it, when the old woman
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the shortest day in all the year, and
I am going home to hold a feast after my travels.
I see you have taken good care of my dog, and
now, if you will come with me to my house, he
and I will do our best to entertain you. Here
is our company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the old woman spoke, there was a sound of
far-off flutes and bugles, then a glare of lights;
and a great company, clad so grandly that they
shone with gold and jewels, came in open chariots,
covered with gilding and drawn by snow-white
horses. The first and finest of the chariots was
empty. The old woman led Child Charity to it
by the hand, and the ugly dog jumped in before
her. No sooner were the old woman and her
dog within the chariot than a marvelous change
passed over them, for the ugly old woman turned
at once to a beautiful young Princess, while the
ugly dog at her side started up a fair young
Prince, with nut-brown hair and a robe of purple
and silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said they, as the chariots drove on,
and the little girl sat astonished, &ldquo;a Prince and
Princess of Fairy-land; and there was a wager
between us whether or not there were good people
still to be found in these false and greedy times.
One said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and the other said &lsquo;No&rsquo;; and I
have lost,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;and must pay for the
feast and presents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Child Charity went with that noble company
into a country such as she had never seen. They
took her to a royal palace, where there was
nothing but feasting and dancing for seven days.
She had robes of pale-green velvet to wear, and
slept in a chamber inlaid with ivory. When the
feast was done, the Prince and Princess gave her
such heaps of gold and jewels that she could not
carry them, but they gave her a chariot to go
home in, drawn by six white horses, and on the
seventh night, when the farmer&#8217;s family had
settled in their own minds that she would never
come back, and were sitting down to supper, they
heard the sound of her coachman&#8217;s bugle, and
saw her alight with all the jewels and gold at
the very back door where she had brought in the
ugly old woman. The fairy chariot drove away,
and never came back to that farmhouse after.
But Child Charity scrubbed and scoured no more,
for she became a great lady even in the eyes of
her proud cousins, who were now eager to pay
her homage.</p>

<h2><a name="GIANT" id="GIANT"></a>THE SELFISH GIANT</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY OSCAR WILDE</strong></p>


<p>Every afternoon, as they were coming from
school, the children used to go and play in the
Giant&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>It was a large, lovely garden, with soft green
grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful
flower-like stars; and there were twelve
peach-trees that in the Springtime broke out into
delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the
Autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the
trees and sang so sweetly that the children used
to stop their games in order to listen to them.
&ldquo;How happy we are here!&rdquo; they cried to each
other.</p>

<p>One day the Giant came back. He had been
to visit his friend the Cornish Ogre, and had
stayed with him for seven years. After the
seven years were over he had said all that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
had to say, and he determined to return to his
own castle. When he arrived, he saw the children
playing in the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; he cried in a
gruff voice, and the children ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own garden is my own garden,&rdquo; said the
Giant; &ldquo;anyone can understand that, and I will
allow nobody to play in it but myself.&rdquo; So he
built a high wall all around it, and put up a notice
board:</p>

<p class="center" style="font-variant: small-caps;">
               trespassers<br />
                 will be<br />
               prosecuted</p>

<p>He was a very selfish Giant.</p>

<p>The poor children had now nowhere to play.
They tried to play on the road, but the road was
very dusty, and full of hard stones, and they did
not like it. They used to wander round the high
wall when their lessons were over, and talk about
the beautiful garden inside. &ldquo;How happy we
were there,&rdquo; they said to one another.</p>

<p>Then the Spring came, and all over the country
there were little blossoms and little birds. Only
in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still
Winter. The birds did not care to sing in it,
as there were no children; and the trees forgot
to blossom. Once a beautiful flower put its head
out from the grass, but when it saw the notice
board it was so sorry for the children that it
slipped back into the ground again, and went off
to sleep. The only people who were pleased were
the Snow and the Frost. &ldquo;Spring has forgotten
this garden,&rdquo; they cried &ldquo;so we will live here all
the year round.&rdquo; The Snow covered up the grass
with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted
all the trees silver. Then they invited the North
Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was
wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about
the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.
&ldquo;This is a delightful spot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must
ask the Hail on a visit.&rdquo; So the Hail came.
Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof
of the castle till he broke most of the slates,
and then he ran round the garden as fast as he
could go. He was dressed in gray, and his
breath was like ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand why the Spring is so late
in coming,&rdquo; said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at
the window and looked out at his cold, white
garden; &ldquo;I hope there will be a change in the
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.
The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden,
but to the Giant&#8217;s garden she gave none. &ldquo;He is
too selfish,&rdquo; she said. So it was always Winter
there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and
the Frost, and the Snow danced about through
the trees.</p>

<p>One morning the Giant was lying awake in
bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded
so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be
the King&#8217;s musicians passing by. It was really
only a little linnet singing outside his window,
but it was so long since he had heard a bird
sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be
the most beautiful music in the world. Then the
Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the
North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume
came to him through the open casement. &ldquo;I
believe the Spring has come at last,&rdquo; said the
Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.</p>

<p>What did he see?</p>

<p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a
little hole in the wall the children had crept in
and they were sitting in the branches of trees.
In every tree that he could see there was a little
child. And the trees were so glad to have the
children back again that they had covered themselves
with blossoms, and were waving their arms
gently above the children&#8217;s heads. The birds were
flying about and twittering with delight, and the
flowers were looking up through the green grass
and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in one
corner it was still Winter. It was the farthest
corner of the garden, and in it was standing a
little boy. He was so small that he could not
reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was
wandering all around it, crying bitterly. The
poor tree was still quite covered with frost and
snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring
above it. &ldquo;Climb up! little boy,&rdquo; said the
tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it
could; but the boy was too tiny.</p>

<p>And the Giant&#8217;s heart melted as he looked out.
&ldquo;How selfish I have been!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;now I
know why the Spring would not come here. I will
put that poor little boy on the top of the tree,
and then I will knock down the wall, and my
garden shall be the children&#8217;s playground for
ever and ever.&rdquo; He was really very sorry for
what he had done.</p>

<p>So he crept downstairs and opened the front
door quite softly, and went out into the garden.
But when the children saw him they all ran away.
Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were
so full of tears that he did not see the Giant
coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and
took him gently in his hand, and put him up into
the tree. And the tree broke at once into blossom,
and the birds came and sang on it, and the
little boy stretched out his two arms and flung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
them round the Giant&#8217;s neck, and kissed him. And
the other children, when they saw that the Giant
was not wicked any longer, came running back,
and with them came the Spring. &ldquo;It is your garden
now, little children,&rdquo; said the Giant, and he
took a great ax and knocked down the wall. And
when the people were going to market at 12
o&#8217;clock they found the Giant playing with the
children in the most beautiful garden they had
ever seen.</p>

<p>All day long they played, and in the evening
they came to the Giant to bid him good-by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is your little companion?&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the boy I put into the tree.&rdquo; The Giant loved
him the best because he had kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&#8217;t know,&rdquo; answered the children; &ldquo;he
has gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell him to be sure and come here
to-morrow,&rdquo; said the Giant. But the children
said that they did not know where he lived, and
had never seen him before; and the Giant felt
very sad.</p>

<p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the
children came and played with the Giant. But
the little boy whom the Giant loved was never
seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the
children, yet he longed for his first little friend,
and often spoke of him. &ldquo;How I would like to
see him!&rdquo; he used to say.</p>

<p>Years went over, and the Giant grew very old
and feeble. He could not play about any more,
so he sat in a huge, armchair, and watched the
children at their games, and admired his garden.
&ldquo;I have many beautiful flowers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
the children are the most beautiful of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One winter morning he looked out of his window
as he was dressing. He did not hate the
Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the
Spring asleep, and that the pretty flowers were
resting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and
looked and looked. It certainly was a marvelous
sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was
a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.
Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung
down from them, and underneath it stood the
little boy he had loved.</p>

<p>Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out
into the garden. He hastened across the grass,
and came near to the child. And when he came
quite close his face grew red with anger, and he
said: &ldquo;Who hath dared to wound thee?&rdquo; For on
the palms of the child&#8217;s hands were the prints of
two nails, and the prints of two nails were on
the little feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who hath dared to wound thee?&rdquo; cried the
Giant; &ldquo;tell me, that I may take my big sword
and slay him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; answered the child; &ldquo;but these are the
wounds of Love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said the Giant, and a strange
awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little
child.</p>

<p>And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to
him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You let me play once in your garden, to-day
you shall come with me to my garden, which is
Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the children ran in that afternoon
they found the Giant lying dead under the tree,
all covered with white blossoms.</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE OF THE BIRDS,<br />
OR, THE GRATEFUL RAVEN AND THE PRINCE</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Scotch Tale</em></p>


<p>Once upon a time a great contest took place
between every wild creature. The son of the
King of Tethertown went to see the battle; but
he arrived late, and saw only one fight. This was
between a huge Raven and a Snake. The King&#8217;s
son ran to aid the Raven, and with one blow took
the head off the Snake. The Raven was very
grateful, and said: &ldquo;Now, I will give thee a
sight; come upon my wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They flew over seven mountains, seven glens,
and seven moors. That night, at the Raven&#8217;s
request, the King&#8217;s son slept in the house of one
of the Raven&#8217;s sisters. He was to meet the
Raven next morning for another trip; and for
three days they journeyed. On the third morning
a handsome boy, who was carrying a bundle,
came to meet the King&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>This boy told how he had been under a spell;
and he was at once released from it by the power
of the King&#8217;s son. In return, he gave him the
bundle which he carried, and cautioned him not
to open it until he found the place where he
desired to dwell.</p>

<p>On the homeward trip the bundle became very
heavy, and the King&#8217;s son stopped in a grove to
open it. Immediately a beautiful castle sprang
up before him. He was very sorry, for he wanted
to live in the glen opposite his father&#8217;s palace.
Just then a Giant appeared and offered to put the
castle back in the bundle on condition that the
Prince give him his first son when he was seven
years old. The Prince promised, and soon he
had his castle in the right place. At the palace
door there was a beautiful maiden, who asked
him to marry her. The wedding took place at
once, and all were happy.</p>

<p>Before many years they had a son; and then
the Prince, who was now King, remembered his
promise to the Giant. When the boy was seven
years old the Giant came to claim him. The
Queen said she would save her child. She dressed
the cook&#8217;s son in fine clothes, and gave him to
the Giant. But the Giant feared some treachery,
and said to the boy: &ldquo;If thy father had a rod
what would he do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would beat the dogs if they went near
the King&#8217;s meat,&rdquo; answered the boy.</p>

<p>Then the Giant knew he had been deceived, and
he went again to the palace. Again the Queen
tried to trick him by giving him the butler&#8217;s son.
When the Giant found he had been fooled a second
time, he stalked back to the castle, and made
a terrible scene. The castle shook under the soles
of his feet as he cried: &ldquo;Out here with thy son,
or the stone that is highest in thy dwelling shall
be the lowest.&rdquo; So, in great fear, the Queen
gave her son to the Giant.</p>

<p>The lad lived many years in the Giant&#8217;s home.
On a certain holiday, when the Giant was away,
the boy heard sweet music. Looking up the stairs
he saw a beautiful little maiden. She beckoned to
him to come to her, then said: &ldquo;To-morrow
you may choose between my two sisters for your
bride; but, I pray you, say you will take only
me. My father is forcing me to marry a Prince
whom I hate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morrow the Giant said: &ldquo;Now, Prince,
you may go home to-morrow, and take with you
either of my two eldest daughters as your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Giant was very angry when the Prince
said: &ldquo;I want only the pretty little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Giant in a great rage imposed three tasks
upon the King&#8217;s son. He had to clean a byre,
or cow-shed, which had not been cleaned for
seven years. Secondly, he was to thatch the byre
with bird&#8217;s down; and lastly, he must climb a tall
fir-tree and bring five eggs, unbroken, from the
magpie&#8217;s nest for the Giant&#8217;s breakfast. These
tasks were too great for any mortal to accomplish,
but the youth was willing to try.</p>

<p>He worked all morning on the dirty byre, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
accomplished practically nothing. At noon, while
he was resting under a tree, the Giant&#8217;s daughter
came and talked to him. In utter dejection he
showed her the impossibility of completing the
task by nightfall. With words of sympathy and
encouragement, she left him and went on her
way. After she had gone, the Prince in great
weariness fell asleep under the tree.</p>

<p>It was evening before he awoke. His first
thought was of the unfinished task, and he jumped
to his feet, though only half awake. He looked
at the byre, and then he rubbed his eyes; and
then he looked at the byre again, for, lo! it was
clean. Some one had come to his aid while he
slept. When the Giant came home, he knew the
King&#8217;s son had not cleaned the byre, but he could
not prove it, so he had to keep his word.</p>

<p>The second and third tasks were done in much
the same way. The Prince would try very hard
to do the work alone, and when he was just about
to fail the Giant&#8217;s daughter would come and encourage
the youth.</p>

<p>In getting the eggs from the magpie&#8217;s nest, the
Giant&#8217;s daughter was in a great hurry, because
she felt her father&#8217;s breath on the back of her
neck. In her haste she left her little finger in
the magpie&#8217;s nest, but there was no time to go
back and get it.</p>

<p>When the third task was finished, the Giant
ordered them to get ready for the wedding.</p>

<p>The Giant tried to deceive the King&#8217;s son at
the very last. The three daughters were dressed
alike, and brought before him, and he was to
choose which one was his promised bride. But
the Prince knew her by the hand on which the
little finger was missing; so all was well.</p>

<p>After the wedding the bride and bridegroom
went to their chamber. The Giant&#8217;s daughter said:
&ldquo;Quick! quick! We must fly. My father plans
to kill you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she took an apple and cut it into four
parts, two of which she put on the bed; one piece
was placed by the door, and the other outside.
After that was done, they hurried out to the
stables, mounted the blue-gray filly, and were off.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Giant was waiting for them
to go to sleep. At last he could wait no longer,
so he called out: &ldquo;Are you asleep yet?&rdquo; And
the apple at the head of the bed answered: &ldquo;No,
we are not asleep.&rdquo; He called out the same thing
three more times, and the three other pieces of
apple answered him the same way. When the
piece outside the door replied, the Giant knew
he had been fooled, and that the couple had fled.
He started after them in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Just at dawn the Giant&#8217;s daughter said: &ldquo;My
father is close behind us, because his breath is
burning my neck. Put thy hand in the filly&#8217;s ear
and throw behind thee whatever thou findest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince did so, and at once a thick forest
of blackthorn sprang up behind them.</p>

<p>At noon the Giant&#8217;s daughter again said: &ldquo;I
feel my father&#8217;s breath on my neck.&rdquo; So the
Prince reached into the filly&#8217;s ear and took a piece
of stone, which he threw behind him. At once
a huge rock was between them and the Giant.</p>

<p>By evening the Giant was close upon them for
the third time. Out of the filly&#8217;s ear the King&#8217;s
son took a bladder of water, and threw it behind
him. A fresh-water lake then stretched twenty
miles behind them. By this time the Giant was
coming so fast that he could not stop, but plunged
headlong into the lake and was drowned.</p>

<p>When they approached the Prince&#8217;s home, the
maiden said she would wait for him by the well.
&ldquo;Go thou and greet thy father, then come back
for me. But let neither man nor creature kiss
thee, or thou wilt forget me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth was welcomed by all his family, but
he kissed none of them. As misfortune would
have it, however, an old grayhound jumped upon
him and licked his face, and then he did not remember
the Giant&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>She waited a long time for his return. After a
while she wandered to an old Shoemaker&#8217;s cottage
and asked him to take her to the palace, that she
might see the newly returned Prince. The Shoemaker,
greatly awed by her unusual beauty, said:
&ldquo;Come with me. I am well acquainted with the
servants at the castle, and will arrange for you to
see the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pretty woman attracted much attention at
the feast. The gentlefolk took her to the banquet
hall and gave her a glass of cordial. Just as she
was going to drink, a flame appeared in the
glass, and a golden pigeon and a silver pigeon
sprang out of the flame. At the same time, three
grains of barley fell upon the floor.</p>

<p>The two pigeons flew down and ate the barley
grains. As they ate, the golden pigeon said: &ldquo;Do
you remember how I cleaned the byre?&rdquo; Three
more grains of barley fell to the ground, and
the golden pigeon again spoke: &ldquo;Do you remember
how I thatched the byre?&rdquo; Still three more
grains fell to the ground, and the golden pigeon
once more spoke: &ldquo;Do you remember how I
robbed the magpie&#8217;s nest? I lost my little finger,
and I lack it still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the King&#8217;s son remembered, and he sprang
and claimed the Giant&#8217;s little daughter as his
bride.</p>

<h2>JACK AND THE BEANSTALK</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY MARY LENA WILSON</strong></p>


<p>A long, long time ago there was a boy named
Jack. He and his mother were very poor, and
lived in a tiny cottage. Jack&#8217;s mother loved him
so much that she could never say no to anything
he asked. So whenever he wanted money she
gave it to him, until at last all they had was
gone. There was nothing left with which to buy
supper. Then the poor woman began to cry, and
said to her son:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, there is nothing in the house to
eat; and there is no money to buy food. You will
have to take the old cow to town and sell her.
She is all we have left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack felt very bad when he saw his mother
crying; so he quickly got the cow and started
off to town. As he was walking along he passed
the butcher, who stopped him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack! what are you driving your cow
away from home for?&rdquo; And Jack replied sadly:
&ldquo;I am taking her to town to sell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he noticed that the butcher held in his
hand some colored beans. They were so beautiful
he could not keep from staring at them.</p>

<p>Now, the butcher was a very mean man. He
knew the cow was worth more than the beans,
but he did not believe Jack knew it, so he said:
&ldquo;You let me have your cow, and I will give you
a whole bag of these beans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was so delighted that he could hardly wait
to get the bag in his hand. He ran off home as
fast as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, mother!&rdquo; he shouted, as he
reached the house; &ldquo;see what I have got for the
old cow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good lady came hurrying out of the house,
but when she saw only a bagful of colored beans
she was so disappointed to think he had sold
her cow &ldquo;for nothing&rdquo; that she flung the beans
as far as she could. They fell everywhere&mdash;on
the steps, down the road, and in the garden.</p>

<p>That night Jack and his mother had to go to
bed without anything to eat.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Jack looked out of his
window, he could hardly believe his eyes. In
the garden where his mother had thrown some
of the beans there were great beanstalks. They
were twisted together so that they made a ladder.
When Jack ran out to the garden to look
more closely he found the ladder reached up,
up&mdash;&#8217;way up into the clouds! It was so high he
could not see the top.</p>

<p>Jack was very excited, and called to his mother:
&ldquo;Mother, dear, come quickly! My beans have
grown into a beautiful beanstalk ladder that
reaches to the sky! I am going to climb up and
see what is at the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hour after hour he climbed, until he was so
tired he could hardly climb any more. At last
he came to the end, and peered eagerly over the
top to see what was there. Not a thing was to
be seen but rocks and bare ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jack to himself. &ldquo;This is a horrid
place. I wish I had never come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then he saw, hobbling along, a wrinkled,
ragged old woman. When she reached Jack she
looked at him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came up the ladder,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/img307.jpg" width="246" height="223" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>The old woman looked at him very sharply.
&ldquo;Do you remember your father?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Jack thought this a queer question, but he replied:
&ldquo;No, I do not. Whenever I ask my mother
about him she cries, and will not tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, the old woman leaned her face very
close to Jack&#8217;s and snapped her bright eyes. &ldquo;<em>I
will tell you</em>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for <em>I am a Fairy</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Fairy smiled. &ldquo;Do not be afraid, my
dear, for I am a good, good Fairy. But before
I tell you anything, you must promise to do exactly
as I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack promised, and the Fairy began her story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long while ago, when you were only a tiny
baby, your father and mother lived in a beautiful
house, with plenty of money and servants
and everything nice. They were very happy, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
everyone loved your father for the kind
things he did. He always helped people who
were poor and in trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, miles and miles away there was a wicked
Giant. He was just as bad as your father was
good. When he heard about your father he
decided to do something very terrible. He went
to your house and <em>killed him</em>. He would have
killed you and your mother, too, but she fell down
on her knees and begged: &lsquo;Oh, please do not
hurt me and my little baby. Take all our treasures,
but do not kill us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now of course the money was what the Giant
really wanted, so he said: &lsquo;If you promise that
you will never tell your little boy who his father
was, or anything about me, I will let you go.
If you do tell him, I shall find out and kill
you both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother quickly promised, and ran out
of the house as fast as she could. All day long
she hurried over the rough roads with you in her
arms. At last, when she could hardly walk a
step further, she came to the little house where
you live now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear Jack. I am your father&#8217;s good
fairy. The reason I could not help him against
the wicked Giant was because I had done something
wrong. When a fairy does something
wrong she loses her power. My power did not
come back to me until the day when you went
to sell your cow. Then <em>I</em> put it into your head
to sell the cow for the pretty beans. <em>I</em> made
the beanstalk grow. <em>I</em> made you climb up the
beanstalk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, this is the country where the
wicked Giant lives. I had you come here so you
could get back your mother&#8217;s treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Jack heard this he was very excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow the road,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;and you
will come to the Giant&#8217;s house. And do not forget
that some day you are to punish the wicked
Giant.&rdquo; And then she disappeared.</p>

<p>Jack had not gone far before he came to a
great house. In front of it stood a little woman.
Jack went up to her and said very piteously:
&ldquo;Oh, please, good, kind lady, let me come in your
beautiful house and have something to eat and
a place to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked surprised. &ldquo;Why, what are
you doing here?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you know
this is where my husband, the terrible Giant,
lives? No one dares to come near here. Every
one my husband finds he has locked up in his
house. Then when he is hungry he <em>eats them</em>!
He walks fifty miles to find some one to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Jack heard this he was very much afraid.
But he remembered what the Fairy had told him,
and once more he asked the woman to let him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just let me sleep in the oven,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
Giant will never find me there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed so tired and sad that the woman
couldn&#8217;t say no, and she gave him a nice supper.</p>

<p>Then they climbed a winding stair and reached
a bright, cozy kitchen. Jack was just beginning
to enjoy himself, when suddenly there was
a great pounding at the front door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; cried the Giant&#8217;s wife; &ldquo;jump
into the oven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was no sooner safely hidden than he
heard the Giant say, in tones of thunder:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Fee, fi, fo, fum,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>When Jack heard this he thought surely the
Giant knew that he was in the house, but the
wife said calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, it is probably the people in the
dungeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they both came down to the kitchen.
The Giant sat so close to the oven that by peeping
through a hole, Jack could easily see him.
He <em>was enormous</em>! And how much he did eat
and drink for his supper! When at last he was
through, he roared:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wife, bring me my hen!&rdquo; And the woman
brought in a beautiful hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay!&rdquo; commanded the Giant; and what was
Jack&#8217;s surprise when the hen laid a golden egg.
Every time the Giant said: &ldquo;Lay!&rdquo;&mdash;and he said
it many times&mdash;the hen obeyed.</p>

<p>At last both the woman and her husband fell
asleep. But Jack did not dare to sleep. He sat
all cramped and tired in the oven, watching the
Giant.</p>

<p>When it began to get light he slowly pushed
the oven door open and crawled out ever so
softly. For a minute he hardly dared breathe
for fear of waking the Giant. Then quick as
a flash, he seized the hen and stole out of the
house as fast as his feet could carry him.</p>

<p>He did not stop running until he reached the
beanstalk. All out of breath, he climbed down
the ladder with the hen in his arms.</p>

<p>Now, all this time, Jack&#8217;s poor mother thought
her son was surely lost. When she saw him
she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, why did you go off and leave me
like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother,&rdquo; said Jack&mdash;and proudly he held
out the hen&mdash;&ldquo;see what I have brought you this
time: a hen that lays golden eggs. Now we can
have everything we want. You need never be sad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack and his mother were very happy together
for many months. Whenever they wanted anything,
they just told the hen to lay a golden egg.</p>

<p>But after a while Jack remembered his promise
to the Fairy to punish the Giant. So he said
to his mother:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother dear, I think I will go back and get
some more of our treasure from the Giant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor woman felt very bad when her son
said this. &ldquo;Oh, please do not go, Jack,&rdquo; she
begged. &ldquo;This time the Giant will find you and
kill you for stealing his hen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack decided he would not worry his mother,
but he would find a way to fool the Giant. He
got some paint to color his skin brown and had
a queer suit of clothes made so that no one
could discover who he was. Without telling anyone,
he got up early one morning and climbed
up the beanstalk.</p>

<p>It was dark and cold before he reached the
Giant&#8217;s house. There at the front door was the
Giant&#8217;s wife; but she did not know Jack in his
queer clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Lady,&rdquo; said Jack, very politely.
&ldquo;Will you let me in for a night&#8217;s rest? I am
very tired and hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the woman shook her head. &ldquo;I can&#8217;t let
anyone in. One night I let in a poor boy like
yourself, and he stole my husband&#8217;s favorite treasure.
My husband is a cruel Giant, and since his
hen was stolen he has been worse than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>please</em> let me come in just for to-night.
If you don&#8217;t I shall have to lie here on the
ground and die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&#8217;t let you do that. But mind, I
shall have to hide you in the lumber-closet, or
my husband may find you and eat you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, Jack was very glad to agree to do
this. As soon as he was safely hidden away he
heard a tremendous noise, and knew that the Giant
had come home. The big fellow walked so heavily
that he shook the whole house.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Fe, fi, fo, fum,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman!&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, my dear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It is an
old piece of meat that a crow left on the roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Giant. &ldquo;Now, hurry and
get my supper.&rdquo; And with that he tried to strike
his poor wife. Jack could see from where he
was hiding that the Giant was even uglier than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was you who let in the boy that stole my
hen,&rdquo; he kept saying to her. And when Jack
heard this he shivered for fear.</p>

<p>After his supper the Giant said in a very cross
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, wife, bring me my bags of gold and
silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old woman brought in two huge bags
and put them down on the table. The Giant
opened each and poured out a great heap of silver
and gold. For a long while he sat counting
the money. But at last he began to get drowsy.
So he put the gold carefully back and fell over
in his chair asleep.</p>

<p>Jack thought maybe the Giant was only pretending
to be asleep, so that he could catch anyone
who might try to take his gold. But when
the Giant had been snoring some time, the boy
carefully opened the door of the closet and tip-toed
over to the table. Not a sound could be
heard except the terrible snoring of the Giant.
Slowly Jack reached out to take the bags of
money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow, wow, wow!&rdquo; And a little dog, which
Jack had not seen before, jumped up from a
corner by the fire, barking furiously. Jack had
never been so frightened in his life as now.
Surely the Giant would wake and kill him.</p>

<p>But the Giant never woke at all. He had eaten
so much that he couldn&#8217;t! So Jack snatched the
bags, and dashed for the beanstalk.</p>

<p>When at last he reached the bottom, he ran
at once to the cottage to show his mother the
treasure.</p>

<p>For three years Jack and his mother lived very
happily together. But all this time Jack could
not forget his promise to the Fairy, and what
might happen to him if he did not keep it.</p>

<p>At last he felt that he must go and kill the
wicked Giant. He got some yellow paint and
another queer suit, so that he would not look
like himself at all. Early one morning, when it
was barely light, he crept softly out of the house
and climbed up into the Giant&#8217;s country.</p>

<p>This time he was bigger and older, and did not
feel nearly so afraid as he had before. He met
the Giant&#8217;s wife, just as he had the two other
times; and after a great deal of coaxing she
let him in, and hid him in the boiler.</p>

<p>He had barely gotten in when he felt the
whole house shake, and knew that the Giant had
come home.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Fe, fi, fo, fum!<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>He roared in a voice louder than ever. But now
Jack was not at all scared. He remembered what
had happened before, and thought he was quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
safe.</p>

<p>But this time the Giant would not listen to
anything his wife said. He jumped up and began
stumping around the room, shouting: &ldquo;There
is fresh meat here! I can smell it! Where is
it?&rdquo; And he put his hand right on the boiler.</p>

<p>Jack held his breath tight, and did not move
a muscle. Just when he felt sure the Giant
was going to lift off the lid and find him, he
heard him say: &ldquo;Well, never mind now. Bring
me my supper.&rdquo; And then he went over to the
table and began to eat.</p>

<p>It seemed to Jack that he ate more than ever.
But suddenly he stopped and called out: &ldquo;Wife,
bring me my harp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor woman ran at once and brought back
the most beautiful harp Jack had ever seen. She
placed it beside her husband, and he commanded:
&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; And the most surprising thing happened:
The harp began to play the loveliest tunes
without anyone touching it at all. Jack thought
he had never seen anything so wonderful, and
said to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That harp really belongs to my mother. I
shall get it away from the Giant and take it to
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon the Giant fell asleep. Jack crawled very
quietly out of the boiler and up toward the
table. He stretched out his hand to seize the
harp; but just as his fingers touched it, it shouted:
&ldquo;Master, master, wake up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was horrified, for he saw at once that
the harp was the Giant&#8217;s fairy, and was trying
to help him.</p>

<p>The Giant opened his eyes, but before he
could get to his feet Jack was running for his
life. Down the winding stair and through the
dark hall he went. He felt the floor tremble
as the Giant came roaring after him. He was
panting for breath when he reached the front
door, but did not dare to stop. If he did, he
knew the Giant would catch him, and that would
be the end of him.</p>

<p>And this is what surely would have happened,
but the Giant had eaten so much for his supper
that he could hardly run at all. Even so,
he was close behind him all the way. And all
the time he kept roaring and shouting, which
frightened Jack all the more.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack reached the beanstalk he called
out: &ldquo;Someone quick! get me a hatchet!&rdquo; Then
he almost fell down the beanstalk in his hurry.</p>

<p>When he reached the bottom the Giant had
already started to come down. &ldquo;Oh, now,&rdquo;
thought poor Jack, &ldquo;he will come and burn our
house, and kill my mother and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a neighbor ran up to Jack with a
hatchet. Jack grabbed it and cut down the beanstalk!
With a terrible crash it fell to the ground,
bringing the Giant with it.</p>

<p>Jack and his friends rushed up to where he
fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is dead! He is dead!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>

<p>When Jack&#8217;s mother heard this she came running
out of the house and flung her arms around
her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, I am so sorry that I have been
all this trouble to you. But I promise I shall
never be any more.&rdquo; And just at this moment
the Fairy appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your Jack is a good boy.
He did all this only because I told him to.&rdquo; To
Jack she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, I hope you will always be
good and kind to your mother. And I hope you
will always be kind to the poor and unhappy
people, just as your father was. If you are, I am
sure that you will both be very happy as long
as you live. Good-by, good-by, my dears!&rdquo; And
before they could thank her the Fairy disappeared.</p>

<p>Jack remembered all she had told him, and he
and his mother lived together very happily all
the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="THUMB" id="THUMB"></a>TOM THUMB</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY LAURA CLARKE</strong></p>


<p>Have you ever heard about Little Thumb, or
Tom Thumb as he was sometimes called? Such
a queer little fellow, and such adventures, you
surely must become acquainted with.</p>

<p>&#8217;Way back in the days of the good King
Arthur, there lived a poor man and his wife
who had no children. They wanted a child more
than anything else in the world; and one day the
woman said to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband, if I had a son, even if he were no
bigger than my thumb, I should be the happiest
woman alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Merlin, the King&#8217;s magician, overheard
this wish; and I suspect he was fond of playing
tricks, for it was not many days before the
woman had a child given her. He was so tiny
that his father burst out laughing when he saw
him, and called him Tom Thumb. But the
parents were as happy as if he had been a large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
boy.</p>

<p>Tom Thumb had many exciting adventures and
narrow escapes, because he was so small. He
used to drive his father&#8217;s horse by standing in
the horse&#8217;s ear and calling out &ldquo;Gee up!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Gee, whoa!&rdquo; just like his father. When people
saw horse and cart going along at a brisk pace,
and heard the voice but saw no driver, you may
be sure they were surprised.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/img311a.jpg" width="216" height="231" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>One day two men saw him, and thought they
might get rich if they could get Tom Thumb,
take him to country fairs, and make him do
funny things to amuse the crowds. They offered
Little Thumb&#8217;s father a sum of gold for the tiny
fellow, but the good man said: &ldquo;I would not take
any sum of money for my dear son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tom whispered in his father&#8217;s ear:
&ldquo;Dear father, take the money and let them have
me. I can easily get away and return home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, if Tom&#8217;s father had known what dangers
were before the little fellow he never would have
consented; but it sounded so easy that he took the
gold, and the men took Tom.</p>

<p>Tom rode on the brim of his new master&#8217;s
hat for a long time, thinking how he might escape.
Finally he saw a field-mouse&#8217;s nest over
a hedge, and he said: &ldquo;Master, I am cold and
stiff; put me down that I may run about and get
warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not suspecting anything, the man put him on
the ground. What was his surprise and anger
when Little Tom darted off through the hedge.
Calling to him to come back, the master with
difficulty climbed over the bushes and started
searching for his small runaway. He looked
behind stones, under clumps of grass, in little
furrows, but never thought of the nest of the
field-mouse.</p>

<p>Little Tom stayed very still long after the
angry voice had died away in the distance. When
he came forth it was dark, and he did not know
which way to go. He was still trying to make
up his mind, when he overheard two robbers on
the other side of the hedge.</p>

<p>The first robber said: &ldquo;There is plenty of gold
and silver in the rector&#8217;s house, but his doors
are locked and his windows barred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other one, &ldquo;and if we break in
we shall wake up the servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conversation gave Tom an idea. Stepping
through the hedge he said in a loud voice: &ldquo;I
can help you. I am so small I can get between
the bars on the window. Then I&#8217;ll pass all the
gold and silver out to you, and when I get out
you can divide with me.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 261px;">
<img src="images/img311b.jpg" width="261" height="294" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>The robbers were pleased with the idea. They
decided between themselves that as soon as they
got the money in their own hands they would
make off and not divide it at all. They never
suspected that Little Thumb was planning to give
them away.</p>

<p>Reaching the rector&#8217;s home they lifted Tom
up, and he crawled between the bars and out
of reach of the robbers.</p>

<p>Then he called out in a very loud voice, so as
to waken the servants: &ldquo;Will you have everything
I can get?&rdquo; The servants came running calling,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thief! Thief!&rdquo; and the two robbers escaped
as fast as their feet would carry them.</p>

<p>Now, the servants were so angry, and told in
such loud voices what they should do if they
caught anyone in the house, that Little Thumb
was very much afraid. So he climbed out through
the window and hid in the barn in the hay.</p>

<p>It is best for little people to stay out of harm&#8217;s
way; the queerest things may happen. While our
small adventurer was peacefully sleeping, the
milkmaid came to give the cattle their morning
fodder. As bad luck would have it, she took
the very truss of hay in which Tom lay; and he
awoke with a start to find himself in the cow&#8217;s
great mouth, in danger of being crushed at any
minute by her tremendous teeth. He dodged back
and forth in terror; and it was a relief when
the cow gave one big swallow, and he slid down
into her roomy stomach.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/img312.jpg" width="238" height="292" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was dark and moist down there, however,
and more hay came down with every swallow; so
Tom called out with all his might: &ldquo;No more
hay, please! no more hay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The milkmaid screamed, and ran to the house,
telling everyone that the cow had been talking
to her just like a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said the rector; &ldquo;cows do not
talk.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he went to the cow-shed. No
sooner had he stepped inside the door than the
cow lifted her head, and a voice called in great
distress: &ldquo;No more hay, please! no more hay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; cried the rector, &ldquo;my beautiful cow is
bewitched! It is best to kill her before she makes
mischief with the other cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the cow was slaughtered, and the stomach,
with Little Thumb inside, was flung away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I will work my way out and run home,&rdquo;
thought Tom. But he was to have another adventure
first. He had just gotten his head free, when
a hungry wolf, attracted by the smell of the
freshly-killed meat, seized the stomach in its jaws
and sprang away into the forest.</p>

<p>Instead of losing courage, Little Thumb began
to plan a way of escape. He decided on a bold
scheme. In his loudest voice he called: &ldquo;Wolf,
if you are hungry, I know where you can get
a choice dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked the wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a house not far away, and I know
a hole through which you can crawl into the
kitchen. Once there you can eat and drink to
your heart&#8217;s content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf did not know that Tom meant his
own home; but the mention of these good things
to eat made him very hungry, and following Tom&#8217;s
directions he quickly reached the house.</p>

<p>Things were exactly as promised. Tom waited
till he was sure the wolf had eaten so much that
he could not get out through the hole he came
in. Then he called from inside the wolf: &ldquo;Father,
mother, help! I am here&mdash;in the wolf&#8217;s body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not take long for the father to finish the
wolf and rescue his dear boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall never let you go again, for all the
riches of the world,&rdquo; said the mother and father.
But Tom was rather pleased with his adventures.</p>

<p>One day, when walking beside the river, he
slipped and fell in. Before he had a chance to
swim out a fish came along and swallowed him.
Tom had escaped so often from such dangers that
he was not much afraid. After a time the fish
saw a dainty worm, and, little thinking that it
was on a hook, took it in its mouth. Before it
realized what had happened it was pulled out of
the water, with Little Thumb still inside.</p>

<p>Now, as luck would have it, this fish was to
be for the King&#8217;s dinner. When the cook opened
the fish to clean it and make it ready for broiling,
out stepped Little Thumb, much to the astonishment
and delight of everyone. The King said
he had never seen so tiny and merry a fellow.
He knighted him, and had Sir Thomas Thumb
and his father and mother live in the palace the
rest of their lives.</p>

<h2>WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT</h2>


<p>In the reign of the famous King Edward III
there was a little boy called Dick Whittington,
whose father and mother died when he was very
young, so that he remembered nothing at all about
them, and was left a ragged little fellow, running
about a country village. As poor Dick was not
old enough to work, he was very badly off; he
got but little for his dinner, and sometimes nothing
at all for his breakfast; for the people who
lived in the village were very poor indeed, and
could not spare him much more than the parings
of potatoes, and now and then a hard crust of
bread.</p>

<p>For all this Dick Whittington was a very sharp
boy, and was always listening to what everybody
talked about. On Sunday he was sure to get
near the farmers, as they sat talking on the
tombstones in the churchyard, before the parson
was come; and once a week you might see little
Dick leaning against the sign-post of the village
inn, where people stopped as they came from the
next market town; and when the barber&#8217;s shop
door was open, Dick listened to all the news that
his customers told one another.</p>

<p>In this manner Dick heard a great many very
strange things about the great city called London;
for the foolish country people at that time
thought that folks in London were all fine gentlemen
and ladies; and that there was singing and
music there all day long; and that the streets
were all paved with gold.</p>

<p>One day a large wagon and eight horses, all
with bells at their heads, drove through the village
while Dick was standing by the sign-post.
He thought that this wagon must be going to the
fine town of London; so he took courage, and
asked the wagoner to let him walk with him by
the side of the wagon. As soon as the wagoner
heard that poor Dick had no father or mother,
and saw by his ragged clothes that he could not
be worse off than he was, he told him he might
go if he would, so they set off together.</p>

<p>It has never been found out how little Dick
contrived to get meat and drink on the road;
nor how he could walk so far, for it was a long
way; nor what he did at night for a place to lie
down and sleep. Perhaps some good-natured people
in the towns that he passed through, when
they saw he was a poor little ragged boy, gave
him something to eat; and perhaps the wagoner
let him get into the wagon at night, and take a
nap upon one of the boxes or large parcels in
the wagon.</p>

<p>Dick however got safe to London, and was in
such a hurry to see the fine streets paved all over
with gold, that he ran as fast as his legs would
carry him, through many of the streets, thinking
every moment to come to those that were paved
with gold; for Dick had seen a guinea three times
in his own little village, and remembered what
a deal of money it brought in change; so he
thought he had nothing to do but to take up
some little bits of the pavement, and should then
have as much money as he could wish for.</p>

<p>Poor Dick ran till he was tired; but at last,
finding it grew dark, and that every way he turned
he saw nothing but dirt instead of gold, he sat
down in a dark corner and cried himself to sleep.</p>

<p>Little Dick was all night in the streets; and
next morning, being very hungry, he got up and
walked about, and asked everybody he met to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
give him a halfpenny to keep him from starving;
but nobody stayed to answer him, and only two
or three gave him a halfpenny; so that the poor
boy was soon quite weak and faint for the want
of food.</p>

<p>At last a good-natured looking gentleman saw
how hungry he looked. &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you go to
work, my lad?&rdquo; said he to Dick. &ldquo;That I would,
but I do not know how to get any,&rdquo; answered
Dick. &ldquo;If you are willing, come along with me,&rdquo;
said the gentleman, and took him to a hay-field,
where Dick worked briskly, and lived merrily till
the hay was made.</p>

<p>After this he found himself as badly off as
before; and being almost starved again, he laid
himself down at the door of Mr. Fitzwarren, a
rich merchant. Here he was soon seen by the
cook-maid, who was an ill-tempered creature,
and happened just then to be very busy dressing
dinner for her master and mistress; so she called
out to poor Dick: &ldquo;What business have you there,
you lazy rogue? there is nothing else but beggars;
if you do not take yourself away, we will
see how you will like a sousing of some dish-water;
I have some here hot enough to make
you jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at that time, Mr. Fitzwarren himself came
home to dinner; and when he saw a dirty ragged
boy lying at the door, he said to him: &ldquo;Why do
you lie there, my boy? You seem old enough
to work; I am afraid you are inclined to be lazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Dick to him, &ldquo;that is
not the case, for I would work with all my heart,
but I do not know anybody, and I believe I am
very sick for the want of food.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor fellow,
get up; let me see what ails you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick now tried to rise, but was obliged to lie
down again, being too weak to stand, for he had
not eaten any food for three days, and was no
longer able to run about and beg a halfpenny
of people in the street. So the kind merchant
ordered him to be taken into the house, and have
a good dinner given him, and be kept to do what
dirty work he was able for the cook.</p>

<p>Little Dick would have lived very happy in this
good family if it had not been for the ill-natured
cook, who was finding fault and scolding him
from morning to night, and besides, she was so
fond of basting, that when she had no meat to
baste, she would baste poor Dick&#8217;s head and
shoulders with a broom, or anything else that
happened to fall in her way. At last her ill-usage
of him was told to Alice, Mr. Fitzwarren&#8217;s
daughter, who told the cook she should be turned
away if she did not treat him kinder.</p>

<p>The ill-humor of the cook was now a little
amended; but besides this Dick had another hardship
to get over. His bed stood in a garret,
where there were so many holes in the floor
and the walls that every night he was tormented
with rats and mice. A gentleman having given
Dick a penny for cleaning his shoes, he thought
he would buy a cat with it. The next day he
saw a girl with a cat, and asked her if she would
let him have it for a penny. The girl said she
would, and at the same time told him the cat
was an excellent mouser.</p>

<p>Dick hid his cat in the garret, and always took
care to carry a part of his dinner to her; and in
a short time he had no more trouble with the
rats and mice, but slept quite sound every night.</p>

<p>Soon after this, his master had a ship ready to
sail; and as he thought it right that all his servants
should have some chance for good fortune
as well as himself, he called them all into the
parlor and asked them what they would send out.</p>

<p>They all had something that they were willing
to venture except poor Dick, who had neither
money nor goods, and therefore could send
nothing.</p>

<p>For this reason he did not come into the parlor
with the rest; but Miss Alice guessed what
was the matter, and ordered him to be called in.
She then said she would lay down some money
for him, from her own purse; but the father
told her this would not do, for it must be something
of his own.</p>

<p>When poor Dick heard this, he said he had
nothing but a cat which he bought for a penny
some time since of a little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fetch your cat then, my good boy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Fitzwarren, &ldquo;and let her go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick went upstairs, and with tears in his eyes
brought down poor puss, and gave her to the
captain.</p>

<p>All the company laughed at Dick&#8217;s odd venture;
and Miss Alice, who felt pity for the poor
boy, gave him some money to buy another cat.</p>

<p>This, and many other marks of kindness shown
him by Miss Alice, made the ill-tempered cook
jealous of poor Dick, and she began to use him
more cruelly than ever, and always made game
of him for sending his cat to sea. She asked
him if he thought his cat would sell for as much
money as would buy a stick to beat him.</p>

<p>At last poor Dick could not bear this usage
any longer, and he thought he would run away
from this place; so he packed up his few things,
and started very early in the morning, on All-hallows
Day, which is the first of November. He
walked as far as Holloway; and there sat down
on a stone, which to this day is called Whittington&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Stone, and began to think to himself which
road he should take as he proceeded onward.</p>

<p>While he was thinking what he should do, the
Bells of Bow Church, which at that time had
only six, began to ring, and he fancied their sound
seemed to say to him:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Turn again, Whittington,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">Lord Mayor of London.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord Mayor of London!&rdquo; said he to himself.
&ldquo;Why, to be sure, I would put up with almost
anything now, to be Lord Mayor of London, and
ride in a fine coach, when I grow to be a man!
Well, I will go back, and think nothing of the
cuffing and scolding of the old cook, if I am to
be Lord Mayor of London at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick went back, and was lucky enough to get
into the house, and set about his work, before
the old cook came downstairs.</p>

<p>The ship, with the cat on board, was a long
time at sea; and was at last driven by the winds
on a part of the coast of Barbary, where the
only people were the Moors, that the English
had never known before.</p>

<p>The people then came in great numbers to see
the sailors, who were of different color to themselves,
and treated them very civilly; and, when
they became better acquainted, were very eager
to buy the fine things with which the ship was
loaded.</p>

<p>When the captain saw this, he sent patterns
of the best things he had to the King of the country;
who was so much pleased with them, that
he ordered the captain to come to the palace.
Here the guests were placed, as it is the custom
of the country, on rich carpets marked with gold
and silver flowers. The King and Queen were
seated at the upper end of the room; and a number
of dishes were brought in for dinner. They
had not sat long, when a vast number of rats
and mice rushed in, helping themselves from
almost every dish. The captain wondered at this,
and asked if these vermin were not very unpleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;very offensive; and the
King would give half his treasure to be freed
of them, for they not only destroy his dinner,
as you see, but they assault him in his chamber,
and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be
watched while he is sleeping for fear of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain jumped for joy; he remembered
poor Whittington and his cat, and told the King
he had a creature on board the ship that would
despatch all these vermin immediately. The
King&#8217;s heart heaved so high at the joy which
this news gave him that his turban dropped off
his head. &ldquo;Bring this creature to me,&rdquo; says he;
&ldquo;vermin are dreadful in a court, and if she will
perform what you say, I will load your ship
with gold and jewels in exchange for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain, who knew his business, took this
opportunity to set forth the merits of Miss Puss.
He told his Majesty that it would be inconvenient
to part with her, as, when she was gone, the rats
and mice might destroy the goods in the ship;
but to oblige his Majesty he would fetch her.
&ldquo;Run, run!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;I am impatient
to see the dear creature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away went the captain to the ship, while another
dinner was got ready. He put puss under
his arm, and arrived at the place soon enough
to see the table full of rats.</p>

<p>When the cat saw them, she did not wait for
bidding, but jumped out of the captain&#8217;s arms,
and in a few minutes laid almost all the rats and
mice dead at her feet. The rest of them in their
fright scampered away to their holes.</p>

<p>The King and Queen were quite charmed to
get so easily rid of such plagues, and desired
that the creature who had done them so great
a kindness might be brought to them for inspection.
Upon which the captain called: &ldquo;Pussy,
pussy, pussy!&rdquo; and she came to him. He then
presented her to the Queen, who started back,
and was afraid to touch a creature who had made
such a havoc among the rats and mice. However,
when the captain stroked the cat and called:
&ldquo;Pussy, pussy,&rdquo; the Queen also touched her and
cried, &ldquo;Putty, putty,&rdquo; for she had not learned
English. He then put her down on the Queen&#8217;s
lap, where she, purring, played with her Majesty&#8217;s
hand, and then sung herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The King, having seen the exploits of Mistress
Puss, and being informed that some day she would
have some little kitties, which in turn would have
other little kitties, and thus stock the whole country,
bargained with the captain for the ship&#8217;s
entire cargo, and then gave him ten times as
much for the cat as all the rest amounted to.</p>

<p>The captain then took leave of the royal party,
and set sail with a fair wind for England, and
after a happy voyage arrived safe in London.</p>

<p>One morning Mr. Fitzwarren had just come to
his counting-house and seated himself at the desk,
when somebody came tap, tap, at the door. &ldquo;Who&#8217;s
there?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fitzwarren. &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; answered
the other; &ldquo;I come to bring you good
news of your ship &lsquo;Unicorn.&rsquo;&rdquo; The merchant,
bustling up instantly, opened the door, and who
should be seen waiting but the captain and factor,
with a cabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
for which the merchant lifted up his eyes and
thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous
voyage.</p>

<p>Then they told the story of the cat, and showed
the rich present that the King and Queen had
sent for her to poor Dick. As soon as the merchant
heard this, he called out to his servants:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Go fetch him&mdash;we will tell him of the same;<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">Pray call him Mr. Whittington by name.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren now showed himself to be a
good man; for when some of his servants said
so great a treasure was too much for him, he
answered: &ldquo;God forbid I should deprive him of
the value of a single penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then sent for Dick, who at that time was
scouring pots for the cook, and was quite dirty.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren ordered a chair to be set for
him, and so he began to think they were making
game of him, at the same time begging them not
to play tricks with a poor simple boy, but to let
him go down again, if they pleased, to his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Whittington,&rdquo; said the merchant,
&ldquo;we are all quite in earnest with you, and I most
heartily rejoice in the news these gentlemen have
brought you; for the captain has sold your cat
to the King of Barbary, and brought you in return
for her more riches than I possess in the
whole world; and I wish you may long enjoy
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren then told the men to open the
great treasure they had brought with them; and
said: &ldquo;Mr. Whittington has nothing to do but
to put it in some place of safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Dick hardly knew how to behave himself
for joy. He begged his master to take
what part of it he pleased, since he owed it
all to his kindness. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Fitzwarren, &ldquo;this is all your own; and I
have no doubt but you will use it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick next asked his mistress, and then Miss
Alice, to accept a part of his good fortune; but
they would not, and at the same time told him
they felt great joy at his good success. But this
poor fellow was too kind-hearted to keep it all
to himself; so he made a present to the captain,
the mate, and the rest of Mr. Fitzwarren&#8217;s servants;
and even to the ill-natured old cook.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised him to send
for a proper tradesman, and get himself dressed
like a gentleman; and told him he was welcome
to live in his house till he could provide himself
with a better.</p>

<p>When Whittington&#8217;s face was washed, his hair
curled, his hat cocked, and he was dressed in a
nice suit of clothes, he was as handsome and
genteel as any young man who visited at Mr.
Fitzwarren&#8217;s; so that Miss Alice, who had once
been so kind to him, and thought of him with
pity, now looked upon him as fit to be her sweetheart;
and the more so, no doubt, because Whittington
was now always thinking what he could
do to oblige her, and making her the prettiest
presents that could be.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzwarren soon saw their love for each
other, and proposed to join them in marriage;
and to this they both readily agreed. A day for
the wedding was soon fixed; and they were attended
to church by the Lord Mayor, the court
of aldermen, the sheriffs, and a great number of
the richest merchants in London, to whom they
afterward gave a very rich feast.</p>

<p>History tells us that Mr. Whittington and his
lady lived in great splendor, and were very happy.
They had several children. He was Sheriff of
London, also Mayor, and received the honor of
knighthood by Henry V.</p>

<p>The figure of Sir Richard Whittington
with his cat in his arms, carved in stone,
was to be seen till the year 1780 over the
archway of the old prison of Newgate, that
stood across Newgate Street.</p>

<h2>WILD ROBIN</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Scotch Fairy Tale</em></p>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY SOPHIE MAY</strong></p>


<p>In the green valley of the Yarrow, near the
castle-keep of Norham, dwelt an honest little
family, whose only grief was an unhappy son,
named Robin.</p>

<p>Janet, with jimp form, bonnie eyes, and cherry
cheeks, was the best of daughters; the boys,
Sandie and Davie, were swift-footed, brave,
kind, and obedient; but Robin, the youngest, had
a stormy temper, and when his will was crossed
he became as reckless as a reeling hurricane.
Once, in a passion, he drove two of his father&#8217;s
&ldquo;kye,&rdquo; or cattle, down a steep hill to their death.
He seemed not to care for home or kindred, and
often pierced the tender heart of his mother
with sharp words. When she came at night, and
&ldquo;happed&rdquo; the bed-clothes carefully about his
form, and then stooped to kiss his nut-brown
cheeks, he turned away with a frown, muttering:
&ldquo;Mither, let me be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a sad case with Wild Robin, who seemed
to have neither love nor conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heart is sair,&rdquo; sighed his mother, &ldquo;wi&#8217;
greeting over sich a son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hates our auld cottage and our muckle
wark,&rdquo; said the poor father. &ldquo;Ah, weel! I could
a&#8217;maist wish the fairies had him for a season, to
teach him better manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This the gudeman said heedlessly, little knowing
there was any danger of Robin&#8217;s being carried
away to Elf-land. Whether the fairies were
at that instant listening under the eaves, will
never be known; but it chanced, one day, that
Wild Robin was sent across the moors to fetch
the kye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll rin away,&rdquo; thought the boy; &ldquo;&#8217;t is hard
indeed if ilka day a great lad like me must mind
the kye. I&#8217;ll gae aff; and they&#8217;ll think me
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he gaed, and he gaed, over round swelling
hills, over old battle-fields, past the roofless ruins
of houses whose walls were crowned with tall
climbing grasses, till he came to a crystal sheet
of water called St. Mary&#8217;s Loch. Here he
paused to take breath. The sky was dull and
lowering; but at his feet were yellow flowers,
which shone, on that gray day, like streaks of
sunshine.</p>

<p>He threw himself wearily upon the grass, not
heeding that he had chosen his couch within a
little mossy circle known as a &ldquo;fairy&#8217;s ring.&rdquo;
Wild Robin knew that the country people would
say the fays had pressed that green circle with
their light feet. He had heard all the Scottish
lore of brownies, elves, will-o&#8217;-the-wisps and the
strange water-kelpies, who shriek with eldritch
laughter. He had been told that the Queen of
the Fairies had coveted him from his birth, and
would have stolen him away, only that, just as
she was about to seize him from the cradle, he
had <em>sneezed</em>; and from that instant the fairy-spell
was over, and she had no more control of
him.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of all these stories, the boy was
not afraid; and if he had been informed that
any of the uncanny people were, even now, haunting
his footsteps, he would not have believed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Wild Robin, &ldquo;the sun is drawing
his nightcap over his eyes, and dropping asleep.
I believe I&#8217;ll e&#8217;en take a nap mysel&#8217;, and see
what comes o&#8217; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In two minutes he had forgotten St. Mary&#8217;s
Loch, the hills, the moors, the yellow flowers.
He heard, or fancied he heard, his sister Janet
calling him home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have ye for supper?&rdquo; he muttered
between his teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parritch and milk,&rdquo; answered the lassie gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parritch and milk! Whist! say nae mair!
Lang, lang may ye wait for Wild Robin: he&#8217;ll
not gae back for oatmeal parritch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next a sad voice fell on his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mither&#8217;s; and she mourns me dead!&rdquo; thought
he; but it was only the far-off village-bell, which
sounded like the echo of music he had heard lang
syne, but might never hear again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&#8217; ye think I&#8217;m not alive?&rdquo; tolled the bell.
&ldquo;I sit all day in my little wooden temple, brooding
over the sins of the parish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A brazen lie!&rdquo; cried Robin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, the truth, as I&#8217;m a living soul! Wae
worth ye, Robin Telfer: ye think yersel&#8217; hardly
used. Say, have your brithers softer beds than
yours? Is your ain father served with larger
potatoes or creamier buttermilk? Whose mither
sae kind as yours, ungrateful chiel? Gae to Elf-land,
Wild Robin; and dool and wae follow ye!
dool and wae follow ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The round yellow sun had dropped behind the
hills; the evening breezes began to blow; and now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
could be heard the faint trampling of small hoofs,
and the tinkling of tiny bridle-bells: the fairies
were trooping over the ground. First of all rode
the Queen.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Her skirt was of the grass-green silk,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mantle o&#8217; the velvet fine;</span><br />
 At ilka tress of her horse&#8217;s mane<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hung fifty silver bells and nine.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>But Wild Robin&#8217;s closed eyes saw nothing: his
sleep-sealed ears heard nothing. The Queen of
the fairies dismounted, stole up to him, and laid
her soft fingers on his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a little man after my ain heart,&rdquo; said
she: &ldquo;I like his knitted brow, and the downward
curve of his lips. Knights, lift him gently, set
him on a red-roan steed, and waft him away to
Fairy-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wild Robin was lifted as gently as a brown
leaf borne by the wind; he rode as softly as if
the red-roan steed had been saddled with satin,
and shod with velvet. It even may be that the
faint tinkling of the bridle-bells lulled him into
a deeper slumber; for when he awoke it was
morning in Fairy-land.</p>

<p>Robin sprang from his mossy couch, and stared
about him. Where was he? He rubbed his eyes,
and looked again. Dreaming, no doubt; but
what meant all these nimble little beings bustling
hither and thither in hot haste? What meant
these pearl-bedecked caves, scarcely larger than
swallow&#8217;s nests? these green canopies, overgrown
with moss? He pinched himself, and gazed
again. Countless flowers nodded to him, and
seemed, like himself, on tip-toe with curiosity,
he thought. He beckoned one of the busy,
dwarfish little brownies toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ken I&#8217;m talking in my sleep,&rdquo; said the
lad; &ldquo;but can ye tell me what dell is this, and
how I chanced to be in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brownie might or might not have heard;
but, at any rate, he deigned no reply, and went
on with his task, which was pounding seeds in
a stone mortar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I Robin Telfer, of the Valley of Yarrow,
and yet canna shake aff my silly dreams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, my lad,&rdquo; quoth the Queen of the Fairies,
giving him a smart tap with her wand, &ldquo;stir
yersel&#8217;, and be at work; for naebody idles in
Elf-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bewildered Robin ventured a look at the little
Queen. By daylight she seemed somewhat sleepy
and tired; and was withal so tiny, that he might
almost have taken her between his thumb and
finger, and twirled her above his head; yet she
poised herself before him on a mullein-stalk and
looked every inch a queen. Robin found her
gaze oppressive; for her eyes were hard, and
cold, and gray, as if they had been little orbs
of granite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get ye to work, Wild Robin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What to do?&rdquo; meekly asked the boy, hungrily
glancing at a few kernels of rye which had rolled
out of one of the brownie&#8217;s mortars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye hungry, my laddie? Touch a grain of
rye if ye dare! Shell these dry beans; and if
so be ye&#8217;re starving, eat as many as ye can boil
in an acorn-cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words she gave the boy a withered
bean-pod, and, summoning a meek little brownie,
bade him see that the lad did not over-fill the
acorn-cup, and that he did not so much as peck
at a grain of rye. Then glancing sternly at her
prisoner, she withdrew, sweeping after her the
long train of her green robe.</p>

<p>The dull days crept by, and still there seemed
no hope that Wild Robin would ever escape from
his beautiful but detested prison. He had no
wings, poor laddie; and he could neither become
invisible nor draw himself through a keyhole
bodily.</p>

<p>It is true, he had mortal companions: many
chubby babies; many bright-eyed boys and girls,
whose distracted parents were still seeking them,
far and wide, upon the earth. It would almost
seem that the wonders of Fairy-land might make
the little prisoners happy. There were countless
treasures to be had for the taking, and the
very dust in the little streets was precious with
specks of gold: but the poor children shivered
for the want of a mother&#8217;s love; they all pined
for the dear home-people. If a certain task
seemed to them particularly irksome, the heartless
Queen was sure to find it out, and oblige them
to perform it, day after day. If they disliked
any article of food, that, and no other, were they
forced to eat, or else starve.</p>

<p>Wild Robin, loathing his withered beans and
unsalted broths, longed intensely for one little
breath of fragrant steam from the toothsome
parritch on his father&#8217;s table, one glance at a
roasted potato. He was homesick for the gentle
sister he had neglected, the rough brothers
whose cheeks he had pelted black and blue; and
yearned for the very chinks in the walls, the
very thatch on the home-roof.</p>

<p>Gladly would he have given every fairy flower,
at the root of which clung a lump of gold ore,
if he might have had his own coverlet &ldquo;happed&rdquo;
about him once more by his gentle mother.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;here is a little man after my ain heart,&rdquo;<br />

</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Mither,&rdquo; he whispered in his dreams, &ldquo;my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
shoon are worn, and my feet bleed; but I&#8217;ll soon
creep hame, if I can. Keep the parritch warm
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robin was as strong as a mountain-goat; and
his strength was put to the task of threshing rye,
grinding oats and corn, or drawing water from
a brook.</p>

<p>Every night, troops of gay fairies and plodding
brownies stole off on a visit to the upper
world, leaving Robin and his companions in ever-deeper
despair. Poor Robin! he was fain to
sing&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Oh, that my father had ne&#8217;er on me smiled!</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, that my mother had ne&#8217;er to me sung!</span><br />
 Oh, that my cradle had never been rocked,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But that I had died when I was young.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Now, there was one good-natured brownie who
pitied Robin. When he took a journey to earth
with his fellow-brownies, he often threshed rye
for the laddie&#8217;s father, or churned butter in his
good mother&#8217;s dairy, unseen and unsuspected.
If the little creature had been watched, and paid
for these good offices, he would have left the
farmhouse forever in sore displeasure.</p>

<p>To homesick Robin he brought news of the
family who mourned him as dead. He stole a
silky tress of Janet&#8217;s fair hair, and wondered to
see the boy weep over it; for brotherly affection
is a sentiment which never yet penetrated the
heart of a brownie. The dull little sprite would
gladly have helped the poor lad to his freedom,
but told him that only on one night of the year
was there the least hope, and that was on Hallow-e&#8217;en,
when the whole nation of fairies ride in procession
through the streets of earth.</p>

<p>So Robin was instructed to spin a dream,
which the kind brownie would hum in Janet&#8217;s
ear while she slept. By this means the lassie
would not only learn that her brother was in
the power of the elves, but would also learn how
to release him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the night before Hallow-e&#8217;en, the
bonnie Janet dreamed that the long-lost Robin
was living in Elf-land, and that he was to pass
through the streets with a cavalcade of fairies.
But, alas! how should even a sister know him
in the dim starlight, among the passing troops
of elfish and mortal riders? The dream assured
her that she might let the first company go by,
and the second; but Robin would be one of the
third.</p>

<p>The full directions as to how she should act
were given in poetical form, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;First let pass the black, Janet,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And syne let pass the brown;</span><br />
 But grip ye to the milk-white steed,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pull the rider down.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
 For <em>I</em> ride on the milk-white steed,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aye nearest the town:</span><br />
 Because I was a christened lad<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">They gave me that renown.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
 My right hand will be gloved, Janet;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">My left hand will be bare;</span><br />
 And these the tokens I give thee,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">No doubt I will be there.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
 They&#8217;ll shape me in your arms, Janet,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A toad, snake, and an eel;</span><br />
 But hold me fast, nor let me gang,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you do love me weel.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
 They&#8217;ll shape me in your arms, Janet,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dove, bat, and a swan:</span><br />
 Cast your green mantle over me,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">I&#8217;ll be myself again.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The good sister Janet, far from remembering
any of the old sins of her brother, wept for joy
to know that he was yet among the living. She
told no one of her strange dream; but hastened
secretly to the Miles Cross, saw the strange
cavalcade pricking through the greenwood, and
pulled down the rider on the milk-white steed,
holding him fast through all his changing shapes.
But when she had thrown her green mantle over
him, and clasped him in her arms as her own
brother Robin, the angry voice of the Fairy Queen
was heard.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Up then spake the Queen of Fairies,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of a blush of rye:</span><br />
 &lsquo;You&#8217;ve taken away the bonniest lad<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all my companie.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
 &lsquo;Had I but had the wit, yestreen,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I have learned to-day,</span><br />
 I&#8217;d pinned the sister to her bed<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere he&#8217;d been won away!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>However, it was too late now. Wild Robin
was safe, and the elves had lost their power
over him forever. His forgiving parents and his
lead-hearted brothers welcomed him home with
more than the old love.</p>

<p>So grateful and happy was the poor laddie that
he nevermore grumbled at his oatmeal parritch,
or minded his kye with a scowling brow.</p>

<p>But to the end of his days, when he heard
mention of fairies and brownies, his mind wandered
off in a mizmaze. He died in peace, and
was buried on the banks of the Yarrow.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF MERLIN</h2>

<p>Merlin was a King in early Britain; he was
also an Enchanter. No one knows who were
his parents, or where he was born; but it is said
that he was brought in by the white waves of the
sea, and that, at the last, to the sea he returned.</p>

<p>When Merlin was King of Britain, it was a
delightful island of flowery meadows. His subjects
were fairies, and they spent their lives in
singing, playing, and enjoyment. The Prime
Minister of Merlin was a tame wolf. Part of
his kingdom was beneath the waves, and his subjects
there were the mermaids. Here, too, everyone
was happy, and the only want they ever felt
was of the full light of the sun, which, coming
to them through the water, was but faint and cast
no shadow. Here was Merlin&#8217;s workshop, where
he forged the enchanted sword Excalibur. This
was given to King Arthur when he began to
reign, and after his life was through it was flung
into the ocean again, where it will remain until
he returns to rule over a better kingdom.</p>

<p>Merlin was King Arthur&#8217;s trusted counselor.
He knew the past, present, and the future; he
could foretell the result of a battle, and he had
courage to rebuke even the bravest Knights for
cowardice. On one occasion, when the battle
seemed to be lost, he rode in among the enemy
on a great white horse, carrying a banner with
a golden dragon, which poured forth flaming fire
from its throat. Because of this dragon, which
became King Arthur&#8217;s emblem, Arthur was known
as Pendragon, and always wore a golden dragon
on the front of his helmet.</p>

<p>Merlin was always fond of elfin tricks. He
would disguise himself&mdash;now as a blind boy,
again as an old witch, and once more as a dwarf.
There was a song about him all over Britain,
which began as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Merlin, Merlin, where art thou going</span><br />
 So early in the day, with thy black dog?<br />
 Oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi! oi!<br />
 Oi! oi! oi! oi! oi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the way the early British explained the
gathering and arrangement of the vast stones
of Stonehenge. After a famous battle had been
won there, Merlin said: &ldquo;I will now cause a
thing to be done that will endure to the world&#8217;s
end.&rdquo; So he bade the King, who was the father
of King Arthur, to send ships and men to Ireland.
Here he showed him stones so great that
no man could handle, but by his magic art he
placed them upon the boats and they were borne
to England. Again by his magic he showed how
to transport them across the land; and after they
were gathered he had them set on end, &ldquo;because,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;they would look fairer than as if they
were lying down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, strange to say, the greatest friend of
Merlin was a little girl. Her name was Vivian;
she was twelve years old, and she was the daughter
of King Dionas. In order to make her acquaintance,
Merlin changed himself into a young
Squire, and when she asked him who was his
master, he said: &ldquo;It is one who has taught me so
much that I could here erect for you a castle,
and I could make many people outside to attack
it and inside to defend it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could thus disport myself,&rdquo; answered
Vivian. &ldquo;I would always love you if you could
show me such wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Merlin described a circle with his wand,
and went back and sat down beside her. Within
a few hours the castle was before her in the
wood, Knights and ladies were singing in its
courtyard, and an orchard in blossom grew about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I done what I promised?&rdquo; asked Merlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair, sweet friend,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have done
so much for me that I am always yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vivian became like a daughter to the old magician,
and he taught her many of the most wonderful
things that any mortal heart could think
of&mdash;things past, things that were done, and part
of what was to come.</p>

<p>You have been told in Tennyson that Vivian
learned so many of Merlin&#8217;s enchantments that
in his old age she took advantage of him and put
him to sleep forever in the hollow of a tree. But
the older legend gives us better news. He showed
her how to make a tower without walls so they
might dwell there together alone in peace. This
tower was &ldquo;so strong that it may never be undone
while the world endures.&rdquo; After it was
finished he fell asleep with his head in her lap,
and she wove a spell nine times around his head
so that he might rest more peacefully.</p>

<p>But the old enchanter does not sleep forever.
Here in the forest of Broceliande, on a magic
island, Merlin dwells with his nine bards, and
only Vivian can come or go through the magic
walls. It was toward this tower, so the legends
say, that, after the passing of King Arthur, Merlin
was last seen by some Irish monks, sailing
away westward, with the maiden Vivian, in a
boat of crystal, beneath the sunset sky.</p>

<h2>THE CUB&#8217;S TRIUMPH</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in a forest a badger
and a mother fox with one little Cub.</p>

<p>There were no other beasts in the wood, because
the hunters had killed them all with bows
and arrows, or by setting snares. The deer, and
the wild boar, the hares, the weasels, and the
stoats&mdash;even the bright little squirrels&mdash;had been
shot, or had fallen into traps. At last, only the
badger and the fox, with her young one, were
left, and they were starving, for they dared not
venture from their holes for fear of the traps.</p>

<p>They did not know what to do, or where to
turn for food. At last the badger said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of a plan. I will pretend to be
dead. You must change yourself into a man, and
take me into the town and sell me. With the
money you get for me, you must buy food and
bring it into the forest. When I get a chance I
will run away, and come back to you, and we will
eat our dinner together. Mind you wait for me,
and don&#8217;t eat any of it until I come. Next week
it will be your turn to be dead, and my turn to
sell&mdash;do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fox thought this plan would do very well;
so, as soon as the badger had lain down and pretended
to be dead, she said to her little Cub:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure not to come out of the hole until I
come back. Be very good and quiet, and I will
soon bring you some nice dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then changed herself into a wood-cutter,
took the badger by the heels and swung him over
her shoulders, and trudged off into the town.
There she sold the badger for a fair price, and
with the money bought some fish, some <em>tofu</em>,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>
and some vegetables. She then ran back to the
forest as fast as she could, changed herself into
a fox again, and crept into her hole to see if little
Cub was all right. Little Cub was there, safe
enough, but very hungry, and wanted to begin
upon the <em>tofu</em> at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the mother fox. &ldquo;Fair play&#8217;s a
jewel. We must wait for the badger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon the badger arrived, quite out of breath
with running so fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&#8217;t been eating any of the
dinner,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I could not get away sooner.
The man you sold me to brought his wife to look
at me, and boasted how cheap he had bought me.
You should have asked twice as much. At last
they left me alone, and then I jumped up and ran
away as fast as I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The badger, the fox, and the Cub now sat down
to dinner, and had a fine feast, the badger taking
care to get the best bits for himself.</p>

<p>Some days after, when all the food was finished,
and they had begun to get hungry again,
the badger said to the fox:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it&#8217;s your turn to die.&rdquo; So the fox pretended
to be dead, and the badger changed himself
into a hunter, shouldered the fox, and went
off to the town, where he made a good bargain,
and sold her for a nice little sum of money.</p>

<p>You have seen, already that the badger was
greedy and selfish. What do you think he did
now? He wished to have all the money, and all
the food it would buy for himself, so he whispered
to the man who had bought the fox:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fox is only pretending to be dead; take
care he doesn&#8217;t run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ll soon settle that,&rdquo; said the man, and he
knocked the fox on the head with a big stick, and
killed her.</p>

<p>The badger next laid out the money in buying
all the nice things he could think of. He carried
them off to the forest, and there ate them all up
himself, without giving one bit to the poor little
Cub, who was all alone, crying for its mother,
very sad, and very hungry.</p>

<p>Poor little motherless Cub! But, being a clever
little fox, he soon began to put two and two together,
and at last felt quite sure that the badger
had, in some way, caused the loss of his
mother.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he would punish the
badger; and, as he was not big enough or strong
enough to do it by force, he was obliged to try
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
another plan.</p>

<p>He did not let the badger see how angry he
was with him, but said in a friendly way:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have a game of changing ourselves
into men. If you can change yourself so cleverly
that I cannot find you out, you will have won the
game; but, if I change myself so that you cannot
find me out, then I shall have won the game. I
will begin, if you like; and, you may be sure, I
shall turn myself into somebody very grand while
I am about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The badger agreed. So then, instead of changing
himself at all, the cunning little Cub just went
and hid himself behind a tree, and watched to
see what would happen. Presently there came
along the bridge leading into the town a
nobleman, seated in a sedan-chair, a great
crowd of servants and men at arms following
him.</p>

<p>The badger was quite sure that this must be
the fox, so he ran up to the sedan-chair, put in
his head, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve found you out! I&#8217;ve won the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A badger! A badger! Off with his head,&rdquo; cried
the nobleman.</p>

<p>So one of the retainers cut off the badger&#8217;s
head with one blow of his sharp sword, the little
Cub all the time laughing unseen behind the
tree.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHIN" id="CHIN"></a>CHIN-CHIN KOBAKAMA</h2>


<p>Once there was a little girl who was very pretty,
but also very lazy. Her parents were rich, and
had a great many servants; and these servants
were very fond of the little girl, and did everything
for her which she ought to have been able
to do for herself. Perhaps this was what made
her so lazy. When she grew up into a beautiful
woman she still remained lazy; but as the servants
always dressed and undressed her, and arranged
her hair, she looked very charming, and
nobody thought about her faults.</p>

<p>At last she was married to a brave warrior, and
went away with him to live in another house
where there were but few servants. She was
sorry not to have as many servants as she had
had at home, because she was obliged to do several
things for herself which other folks had always
done for her, and it was a great deal of
trouble to her to dress herself, and take care of
her own clothes, and keep herself looking neat
and pretty to please her husband. But as he was
a warrior, and often had to be far away from
home with the army, she could sometimes be just
as lazy as she wished, and her husband&#8217;s parents
were very old and good-natured, and never
scolded her.</p>

<p>Well, one night while her husband was away
with the army, she was awakened by queer little
noises in her room. By the light of a big paper
lantern she could see very well, and she saw
strange things.</p>

<p>Hundreds of little men, dressed just like Japanese
warriors, but only about one inch high,
were dancing all around her pillow. They wore
the same kind of dress her husband wore on holidays
(<em>Kamishimo</em>, a long robe with square
shoulders), and their hair was tied up in knots,
and each wore two tiny swords. They all looked
at her as they danced, and laughed, and they all
sang the same song over and over again:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Chin-chin Kobakama,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yomo fuk&eacute; s&#333;ro&mdash;</span><br />
 Oshizumare, Hime-gimi!&mdash;<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ya ton ton!&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Which meant: &ldquo;We are the Chin-chin Kobakama;
the hour is late; sleep, honorable, noble
darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words seemed very polite, but she soon
saw that the little men were only making cruel
fun of her. They also made ugly faces at her.</p>

<p>She tried to catch some of them, but they
jumped about so quickly that she could not. Then
she tried to drive them away, but they would
not go, and they never stopped singing:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Chin-chin Kobakama....&rdquo;</p>

<p>and laughing at her. Then she knew they were
little fairies, and became so frightened that she
could not even cry out. They danced around her
until morning; then they all vanished suddenly.</p>

<p>She was ashamed to tell anybody what had
happened, because, as she was the wife of a warrior,
she did not wish anybody to know how
frightened she had been.</p>

<p>Next night, again, the little men came and
danced; and they came also the night after that,
and every night, always at the same hour, which
the old Japanese used to call the &ldquo;hour of the
ox&rdquo;; that is, about two o&#8217;clock in the morning by
our time. At last she became very sick, through
want of sleep and through fright. But the little
men would not leave her alone.</p>

<p>When her husband came back home he was
very sorry to find her sick in bed. At first she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
was afraid to tell him what had made her ill, for
fear that he would laugh at her. But he was so
kind, and coaxed her so gently, that after a while
she told him what happened every night.</p>

<p>He did not laugh at her at all, but looked very
serious for a time. Then he asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time do they come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered, &ldquo;Always at the same hour&mdash;the
&lsquo;hour of the ox.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;to-night I
shall hide, and watch for them. Do not be
frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that night the warrior hid himself in a closet
in the sleeping-room, and kept watch through a
chink between the sliding doors.</p>

<p>He waited and watched until the &ldquo;hour of the
ox.&rdquo; Then, all at once, the little men came up
through the mats, and began their dance and their
song:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Chin-chin Kobakama,</span><br />
 Yomo fuk&eacute; s&#333;ro....&rdquo;</p>

<p>They looked so queer, and danced in such a
funny way, that the warrior could scarcely keep
from laughing. But he saw his young wife&#8217;s
frightened face; and then, remembering that
nearly all Japanese ghosts and goblins are afraid
of a sword, he drew his blade and rushed out of
the closet, and struck at the little dancers. Immediately
they all turned into&mdash;what do you think?</p>

<p class="center"><em>Toothpicks!</em></p>

<p>There were no more little warriors&mdash;only a lot
of old toothpicks scattered over the mats.</p>

<p>The young wife had been too lazy to put her
toothpicks away properly; and every day, after
having used a new toothpick, she would stick it
down between the mats on the floor, to get rid
of it. So the little fairies who take care of the
floor-mats became angry with her, and tormented
her.</p>

<p>Her husband scolded her, and she was so
ashamed that she did not know what to do. A
servant was called, and the toothpicks were taken
away and burned, and after that the little men
never came back again.</p>

<h2><a name="MALLET" id="MALLET"></a>THE WONDERFUL MALLET</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there were two brothers. The
elder was an honest and good man, but he was
very poor, while the younger, who was dishonest
and stingy, had managed to pile up a large fortune.
The name of the elder was Kan&eacute;, and that
of the younger was Ch&ocirc;.</p>

<p>Now, one day Kan&eacute; went to Ch&ocirc;&#8217;s house, and
begged for the loan of some seed-rice and some
silkworms&#8217; eggs, for last season had been unfortunate,
and he was in want of both.</p>

<p>Ch&ocirc; had plenty of good rice and excellent silkworms&#8217;
eggs, but he was such a miser that he did
not want to lend them. At the same time, he felt
ashamed to refuse his brother&#8217;s request, so he
gave him some worm-eaten musty rice and some
dead eggs, which he felt sure would never hatch.</p>

<p>Kan&eacute;, never suspecting that his brother would
play him such a shabby trick, put plenty of mulberry
leaves with the eggs, to be food for the silkworms
when they should appear. Appear they
did, and throve and grew wonderfully, much better
than those of the stingy brother, who was
angry and jealous when he heard of it.</p>

<p>Going to Kan&eacute;&#8217;s house one day, and finding his
brother was out, Ch&ocirc; took a knife and killed all
the silkworms, cutting each poor little creature in
two; then he went home without having been
seen by anybody.</p>

<p>When Kan&eacute; came home he was dismayed to
find his silkworms in this state, but he did not
suspect who had done him this bad trick, and
tried to feed them with mulberry leaves as before.
The silkworms came to life again, and
doubled the number, for now each half was a living
worm. They grew and throve, and the silk
they spun was twice as much as Kan&eacute; had expected.
So now he began to prosper.</p>

<p>The envious Ch&ocirc;, seeing this, cut all his own
silkworms in half, but, alas! they did not come to
life again, so he lost a great deal of money, and
became more jealous than ever.</p>

<p>Kan&eacute; also planted the rice-seed which he had
borrowed from his brother, and it sprang up, and
grew and flourished far better than Ch&ocirc;&#8217;s had
done.</p>

<p>The rice ripened well, and he was just intending
to cut and harvest it when a flight of thousands
upon thousands of swallows came and began
to devour it. Kan&eacute; was much astonished, and
shouted and made as much noise as he could in
order to drive them away. They flew away, indeed,
but came back immediately, so that he kept
driving them away, and they kept flying back
again.</p>

<p>At last he pursued them into a distant field,
where he lost sight of them. He was by this
time so hot and tired that he sat down to rest.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
By little and little his eyes closed, his head
dropped upon a mossy bank, and he fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Then he dreamed that a merry band of children
came into the field, laughing and shouting.
They sat down upon the ground in a ring, and
one who seemed the eldest, a boy of fourteen or
fifteen, came close to the bank on which he lay
asleep, and, raising a big stone near his head,
drew from under it a small wooden Mallet.</p>

<p>Then in his dream Kan&eacute; saw this big boy stand
in the middle of the ring with the Mallet in his
hand, and ask the children each in turn, &ldquo;What
would you like the Mallet to bring you?&rdquo; The
first child answered, &ldquo;A kite.&rdquo; The big boy shook
the Mallet, upon which appeared immediately a
fine kite with tail and string all complete. The
next cried, &ldquo;A battledore.&rdquo; Out sprang a splendid
battledore and a shower of shuttlecocks.
Then a little girl shyly whispered, &ldquo;A doll.&rdquo; The
Mallet was shaken, and there stood a beautifully
dressed doll. &ldquo;I should like all the fairy-tale
books that have ever been written in the whole
world,&rdquo; said a bright-eyed intelligent maiden, and
no sooner had she spoken than piles upon piles
of beautiful books appeared. And so at last the
wishes of all the children were granted, and they
stayed a long time in the field with the things the
Mallet had given them. At last they got tired,
and prepared to go home; the big boy first carefully
hiding the Mallet under the stone from
whence he had taken it. Then all the children
went away.</p>

<p>Presently Kan&eacute; awoke, and gradually remembered
his dream. In preparing to rise he turned
round, and there, close to where his head had
lain, was the big stone he had seen in his dream.
&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; he thought, expecting he hardly
knew what; he raised the stone, and there lay the
Mallet!</p>

<p>He took it home with him, and, following the
example of the children he had seen in his dream,
shook it, at the same time calling out, &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Rice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sak&eacute;.&rdquo; Whatever he called
for flew immediately out of the Mallet, so that he
could have everything he wanted, and as much of
it as he liked.</p>

<p>Kan&eacute; being now a rich and prosperous man,
Ch&ocirc; was of course jealous of him, and determined
to find a magic mallet which would do as
much for him. He came, therefore, to Kan&eacute; and
borrowed seed-rice, which he planted and tended
with care, being impatient for it to grow and
ripen soon.</p>

<p>It grew well and ripened soon, and now Ch&ocirc;
watched daily for the swallows to appear. And,
to be sure, one day a flight of swallows came and
began to eat up the rice.</p>

<p>Ch&ocirc; was delighted at this, and drove them
away, pursuing them to the distant field where
Kan&eacute; had followed them before. There he lay
down, intending to go to sleep as his brother had
done, but the more he tried to go to sleep the
wider awake he seemed.</p>

<p>Presently the band of children came skipping
and jumping, so he shut his eyes and pretended to
be asleep, but all the time watched anxiously what
the children would do. They sat down in a ring,
as before, and the big boy came close to Ch&ocirc;&#8217;s
head and lifted the stone. He put down his hand
to lift the Mallet, but no mallet was there.</p>

<p>One of the children said, &ldquo;Perhaps that lazy
old farmer has taken our Mallet.&rdquo; So the big
boy laid hold of Ch&ocirc;&#8217;s nose, which was rather
long, and gave it a good pinch, and all the other
children ran up and pinched and pulled his nose,
and the nose itself got longer and longer; first it
hung down to his chin, then over his chest, next
down to his knees, and at last to his very feet.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Ch&ocirc; protested his innocence;
the children pinched and pummeled him to
their hearts&#8217; content, then capered round him,
shouting and laughing, and making game of him,
and so at last went away.</p>

<p>Now Ch&ocirc; was left alone, a sad and angry man.
Holding his long nose painfully in both hands, he
slowly took his way toward his brother Kan&eacute;&#8217;s
house. Here he related all that had happened to
him from the very day when he had behaved so
badly about the seed-rice and silkworms&#8217; eggs.
He humbly begged his brother to pardon him,
and, if possible, do something to restore his unfortunate
nose to its proper size.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted Kan&eacute; pitied him, and said:
&ldquo;You have been dishonest and mean, and selfish
and envious, and that is why you have got this
punishment. If you promise to behave better for
the future, I will try what can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he took the Mallet and rubbed Ch&ocirc;&#8217;s
nose with it gently, and the nose gradually became
shorter and shorter until at last it came back
to its proper shape and size. But ever after, if
at any time Ch&ocirc; felt inclined to be selfish and dishonest,
as he did now and then, his nose began to
smart and burn, and he fancied he felt it beginning
to grow. So great was his terror of having
a long nose again that these symptoms
never failed to bring him back to his good behavior.</p>

<h2>THE SELFISH SPARROW<br />
AND THE HOUSELESS CROWS</h2>


<p>A Sparrow once built a nice little house for herself,
and lined it well with wool and protected it
with sticks, so that it resisted equally the summer
sun and the winter rains. A Crow who lived
close by had also built a house, but it was not
such a good one, being only made of a few sticks
laid one above another on the top of a prickly-pear
hedge. The consequence was that one day,
when there was an unusually heavy shower, the
Crow&#8217;s nest was washed away, while the Sparrow&#8217;s
was not at all injured.</p>

<p>In this extremity the Crow and her mate went
to the Sparrow, and said: &ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow,
have pity on us and give us shelter, for the wind
blows and the rain beats, and the prickly-pear
hedge-thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo; But the Sparrow
answered: &ldquo;I&#8217;m cooking the dinner; I cannot
let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a little while the Crows returned and said:
&ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us and give us
shelter, for the wind blows and the rain beats, and
the prickly-pear hedge-thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo;
The Sparrow answered: &ldquo;I&#8217;m eating my dinner;
I cannot let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Crows flew away, but in a little while returned,
and cried once more: &ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow,
have pity on us and give us shelter, for the wind
blows and the rain beats, and the prickly-pear
hedge-thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo; The Sparrow
replied: &ldquo;I&#8217;m washing my dishes; I cannot let
you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Crows waited a while and then called out:
&ldquo;Sparrow, Sparrow, have pity on us and give us
shelter, for the wind blows and the rain beats,
and the prickly-pear hedge-thorns stick into our
eyes.&rdquo; But the Sparrow would not let them in;
she only answered: &ldquo;I&#8217;m sweeping the floor; I
cannot let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next time the Crows came and cried: &ldquo;Sparrow,
Sparrow, have pity on us and give us shelter,
for the wind blows and the rain beats, and
the prickly-pear hedge-thorns stick into our eyes.&rdquo;
She answered: &ldquo;I&#8217;m making the beds; I cannot
let you in now; come again presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, on one pretense or another she refused to
help the poor birds. At last, when she and her
children had had their dinner, and she had prepared
and put away the dinner for next day, and
had put all the children to bed and gone to bed
herself, she cried to the Crows: &ldquo;You may come
in now and take shelter for the night.&rdquo; The
Crows came in, but they were much vexed at having
been kept out so long in the wind and the
rain, and when the Sparrow and all her family
were asleep, the one said to the other: &ldquo;This
selfish Sparrow had no pity on us; she gave us
no dinner, and would not let us in till she and all
her children were comfortably in bed; let us punish
her.&rdquo; So the two Crows took all the nice dinner
the Sparrow had prepared for herself and her
children to eat the next day, and flew away with
it.</p>

<h2><a name="ZIRAC" id="ZIRAC"></a>THE STORY OF ZIRAC</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a raven, a rat, and a tortoise,
having agreed to be friends together, were having
a pleasant chat when they saw a wild goat making
its way toward them with surprising swiftness.
They took it for granted by her speed that
she was pursued by some hunter, and they at
once without ceremony separated, every one to
take care of himself. The tortoise slipped into
the water, the rat crept into a hole, which he fortunately
found near at hand, and the raven hid
himself among the boughs of a very high tree.
In the meantime the goat stopped quite suddenly,
and stood to rest herself by the side of a fountain,
when the raven, who had looked all round
and perceived no one, called to the tortoise, who
immediately peeped above the water, and seeing
the goat afraid to drink, said: &ldquo;Drink boldly, my
friend, for the water is very clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the goat had done so, the tortoise continued:
&ldquo;Pray tell me what is the reason you appear
in such distress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reason enough,&rdquo; said the goat; &ldquo;for I have
just made my escape out of the hands of a
hunter, who pursued me with an eager chase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the tortoise, &ldquo;I am glad you are
safe. I have an offer to make you. If you like
our company, stay here and be one of our friends;
you will find our hearts honest and our company
useful to you. The sages say that a number of
friends lessens trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this short speech the raven and the rat
joined in the invitation, so that the goat at once
promised to become one of them, each promising
the other to prove himself a real and true friend
whatever might happen in days to come. After
this agreement these four friends lived in perfect
harmony for a very long time, and spent their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
time pleasantly together. But one day, as the tortoise,
the rat, and the raven were met, as they
used to do, by the side of the fountain, the goat
was missing. This gave great trouble to them,
as they knew not what had happened. They very
soon came to a resolution, however, to seek for
and assist the goat, so the raven at once mounted
into the air to see what discoveries he could
make; and looking round about him, at length, to
his great sorrow, saw at a distance the poor goat
entangled in a hunter&#8217;s net. He immediately
dropped down in order to acquaint the rat and
tortoise with what he had seen; and you may be
sure that these ill tidings caused great grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have promised firm friendship to one another
and lived very happily together so long,&rdquo;
said the tortoise, &ldquo;that it would be shameful to
break the bond and not act up to all we said. We
cannot leave our innocent and good-natured companion
in this dire distress and great danger.
No! we must find some way to deliver our poor
friend goat out of captivity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said the raven to the rat, who was nicknamed
Zirac: &ldquo;Remember, O excellent Zirac, there is
none but thyself able to set our friend at liberty;
and the business must be quickly done for fear
the huntsman should lay his hands upon her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubt not,&rdquo; replied Zirac, &ldquo;but that I will do
my best, so let us go at once that no time may be
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this the raven took up Zirac in his bill and
flew with him to the place where the poor goat
was confined in the net. No sooner had he arrived
than he at once commenced to gnaw the
meshes of the net that held the goat&#8217;s foot and
had almost set him at liberty when the tortoise
arrived.</p>

<p>As soon as the goat saw the tortoise she cried
out with a loud voice: &ldquo;Oh, why have you ventured
to come hither, friend tortoise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I could no longer bear your absence,&rdquo;
replied the tortoise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; said the goat, &ldquo;your coming to
this place troubles me as much as the loss of my
own liberty; for if the hunter should happen to
come, what would you do to make your escape?
For my part I am almost free, and my being able
to run will prevent me from falling into his hands
again; our friend the raven can find safety in
flight, and Zirac can run into any hole. Only
you, who are so slow of foot, will become the
hunter&#8217;s prey.&rdquo; No sooner had the goat thus
spoken, when sure enough the hunter appeared;
but the goat, being free, swiftly ran away; the
raven mounted into the air, and Zirac slipped
into a hole, and true enough, as the goat had said,
only the slow-paced tortoise remained without
help.</p>

<p>When the hunter arrived he was a little surprised
to see his net broken and the goat missing.
This was no small vexation to him, and caused
him to look closely around, to see if he could discover
who had done the mischief; and unfortunately,
in thus searching, he spied the tortoise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Very good; I am glad
to see you here. I find I shall not go home
empty-handed after all; here is a plump tortoise,
and that is worth something, I&#8217;m sure.&rdquo; Thus
saying, he took up the tortoise, put it in a sack,
threw the sack over his shoulder, and was soon
trudging home.</p>

<p>After he had gone the three friends came out
from their several hiding-places, and met together,
when, missing the tortoise, they at once
judged what had become of him. Then, uttering
bitter cries and lamentations, they shed torrents
of tears. At length the raven broke the silence,
and said: &ldquo;Dear friends, our moans and sorrow
do not help the tortoise. We must, if it be at all
possible, devise some means of saving his life.
Our sages have often told us that there are three
persons that are never well known but on special
occasions&mdash;men of courage in fight, men of honesty
in business, and a true friend in extreme
necessity. We find, alas! our dear companion
the tortoise is in a sad condition, and therefore we
must, if possible, help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is first-class advice,&rdquo; replied Zirac. &ldquo;Now
I think I know how it can be done. Let our friend
the goat go and show herself to the hunter, who
will then be certain to lay down the sack to run
after her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the goat, &ldquo;I will pretend to
be lame, and run limping at a little distance before
him, which will encourage him to follow me,
and thus draw him a good way from his sack,
which will give Zirac time to set our friend at
liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This plan appeared such a good one that it was
at once approved of, and immediately the goat ran
halting before the hunter, and appeared to be so
feeble and faint that her pursuer thought he had
her safe in his clutches again, and so, laying down
his sack, ran after the goat with all his might.
That cunning creature suffered him now and
again almost to come up to her, and then led him
another wild-goose chase till at last she had lured
him out of sight; which Zirac seeing, began
gnawing the string that tied the mouth of the
sack, and soon set free the tortoise, who went at
once and hid himself in a thick bush.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/img331.jpg" width="378" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;oh, why have you ventured to come?&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>At length the hunter, tired of running after
his prey, gave up the chase, and returned to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
up his sack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have something safe; thou
art not quite so swift as that plaguing goat; and
if thou wert, art too well confined here to find the
way to make thy little legs any use to thee.&rdquo; So
saying, he went to the bag, but not finding the
tortoise he was amazed, and thought himself in
a region of hobgoblins and spirits, since he had
by some mysterious means lost two valuable objects,
a goat and a tortoise! He did not know,
you see, what wonders true friendship can work
when all are pledged to help one another.</p>

<p>The four friends soon met together again, congratulated
one another on their escapes, made
afresh their vows of friendship, and declared that
they would never separate until death parted
them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="RICE" id="RICE"></a>MY LORD BAG OF RICE</h2>


<p>Long, long ago there lived in Japan a brave warrior
known to all as Tawara Toda, or &ldquo;My Lord
Bag of Rice.&rdquo; His true name was Fujiwara
Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story
of how he came to change his name.</p>

<p>One day he sallied forth in search of adventures,
for he had the nature of a warrior and
could not bear to be idle. So he buckled on his
two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than
himself, in his hand, and slinging his quiver on
his back started out. He had not gone far when
he came to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning
one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. No
sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw
lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon.
Its body was so big that it looked like
the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the
whole width of the bridge. One of its huge
claws rested on the parapet of one side of the
bridge, while its tail lay right against the other.
The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it
breathed, fire and smoke came out of its nostrils.</p>

<p>At first Hidesato could not help feeling
alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying
in his path, for he must either turn back or walk
right over its body. He was a brave man, however,
and putting aside all fear went forward
dauntlessly. Crunch, crunch; he stepped now on
the dragon&#8217;s body, now between its coils, and
without even one glance backward he went on
his way.</p>

<p>He had only gone a few steps when he heard
some one calling him from behind. On turning
back he was much surprised to see that the monster
dragon had entirely disappeared and in its
place was a strange-looking man, who was bowing
most ceremoniously to the ground. His red
hair streamed over his shoulders and was surmounted
by a crown in the shape of a dragon&#8217;s
head, and his sea-green dress was patterned with
shells. Hidesato knew at once that this was no
ordinary mortal and he wondered much at the
strange occurrence. Where had the dragon gone
in such a short space of time? Or had it transformed
itself into this man, and what did the
whole thing mean? While these thoughts passed
through his mind he had come up to the man on
the bridge and now addressed him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it you that called me just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was I,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;I have an
earnest request to make to you. Do you think
you can grant it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is in my power to do so I will,&rdquo; answered
Hidesato, &ldquo;but first tell me who you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my
home is in these waters just under this bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is it you have to ask of me?&rdquo; said
Hidesato.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede,
who lives on the mountain beyond,&rdquo; and
the Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the
opposite shore of the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lived now for many years in this lake
and I have a large family of children and grandchildren.
For some time past we have lived in
terror, for a monster centipede has discovered
our home, and night after night it comes and
carries off one of my family. I am powerless to
save them. If it goes on much longer like this,
not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself
must fall a victim to the monster. I am,
therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity
I determined to ask the help of a human being.
For many days with this intention I have waited
on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon
that you saw, in the hope that some
strong brave man would come along. But all
who came this way, as soon as they saw me
were terrified and ran away as fast as they
could. You are the first man I have found able
to look at me without fear, so I knew at once
that you were a man of great courage. I beg
you to have pity upon me. Will you not help
me and kill my enemy the centipede?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King
on hearing his story, and readily promised to
do what he could to help him. The warrior
asked where the centipede lived, so that he
might attack the creature at once. The Dragon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
King replied that its home was on the mountain
Mikami, but that as it came every night at
a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would
be better to wait till then. So Hidesato was
conducted to the palace of the Dragon King,
under the bridge. Strange to say, as he followed
his host downward the waters parted to
let them pass, and his clothes did not even feel
damp as he passed through the flood. Never
had Hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this
palace built of white marble beneath the lake.
He had often heard of the Sea King&#8217;s Palace at
the bottom of the sea, where all the servants
and retainers were salt-water fishes, but here
was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake
Biwa. The dainty goldfishes, red carp, and silvery
trout, waited upon the Dragon King and
his guest.</p>

<p>Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was
spread for him. The dishes were crystallized
lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were
of the rarest ebony. As soon as they sat down,
the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish
dancers came out, and behind them followed ten
red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen.
Thus the hours flew by till midnight, and the
beautiful music and dancing had banished all
thoughts of the centipede. The Dragon King
was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup
of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken
by a tramp, tramp! as if a mighty army had
begun to march not far away.</p>

<p>Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet
and rushed to the balcony, and the warrior saw
on the opposite mountain two great balls of
glowing fire coming nearer and nearer. The
Dragon King stood by the warrior&#8217;s side trembling
with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The centipede! The centipede! Those two
balls of fire are its eyes. It is coming for its
prey! Now is the time to kill it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and,
in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind
the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an
enormous centipede winding round the mountains,
and the light in its hundred feet glowed
like so many distant lanterns moving slowly toward
the shore.</p>

<p>Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear.
He tried to calm the Dragon King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be afraid. I shall surely kill the
centipede. Just bring me my bow and arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the
warrior noticed that he had only three arrows
left in his quiver. He took the bow, and fitting
an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let
fly.</p>

<p>The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle
of its head, but instead of penetrating, it
glanced off harmless and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow,
fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly.
Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the
centipede right in the middle of its head, only
to glance off and fall to the ground. The centipede
was invulnerable to weapons! When the
Dragon King saw that even this brave warrior&#8217;s
arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he
lost heart and began to tremble with fear.</p>

<p>The warrior saw that he had now only one
arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed
he could not kill the centipede. He looked
across the waters. The huge reptile had wound
its horrid body seven times round the mountain and
would soon come down to the lake. Nearer
and nearer gleamed the fire-balls of eyes, and
the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections
in the still waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the warrior remembered that
he had heard that human saliva was deadly to
centipedes. But this was no ordinary centipede.
This was so monstrous that even to think of
such a creature made one creep with horror.
Hidesato determined to try his last chance. So
taking his last arrow and first putting the end
of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow,
took careful aim once more and let fly.</p>

<p>This time the arrow again hit the centipede
right in the middle of its head, but instead of
glancing off harmlessly as before it struck home
to the creature&#8217;s brain. Then with a convulsive
shudder the serpentine body stopped moving,
and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred
feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of
a stormy day, and then went out in blackness.
A great darkness now overspread the heavens,
the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, and
the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the
world were coming to an end. The Dragon King
and his children and retainers all crouched in
different parts of the palace, frightened to death,
for the building was shaken to its foundations.
At last the dreadful night was over. Day
dawned beautiful and clear. The centipede was
gone from the mountain.</p>

<p>Then Hidesato called to the Dragon King to
come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede
was dead and he had nothing more to fear.</p>

<p>Then all the inhabitants of the palace came
out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake.
There lay the body of the dead centipede floating
on the water, which was dyed red with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
blood.</p>

<p>The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no
bounds. The whole family came and bowed
down before the warrior, calling him their preserver
and the bravest warrior in all Japan.</p>

<p>Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous
than the first. All kinds of fish, prepared in
every imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and
roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes,
were put before him, and the wine was the best
that Hidesato had ever tasted in his life. To
add to the beauty of everything the sun shone
brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond,
and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful
by day than by night.</p>

<p>His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay
a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home,
saying that he had now finished what he had
come to do, and must return. The Dragon King
and his family were all very sorry to have him
leave so soon, but since he would go they begged
him to accept a few small presents (so they
said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering
them for ever from their horrible enemy
the centipede.</p>

<p>As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave,
a train of fish was suddenly transformed into a
retinue of men, all wearing ceremonial robes and
dragon&#8217;s crowns on their heads to show that they
were servants of the great Dragon King. The
presents that they carried were as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
  First, a large bronze bell.<br />
  Second, a bag of rice.<br />
  Third, a roll of silk.<br />
  Fourth, a cooking pot.<br />
  Fifth, a bell.</p>

<p>Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents,
but as the Dragon King insisted, he could
not well refuse.</p>

<p>The Dragon King himself accompanied the
warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave
of him with many bows and good wishes, leaving
the procession of servants to accompany
Hidesato to his house with the presents.</p>

<p>The warrior&#8217;s household and servants had
been very much concerned when they found that
he did not return the night before, but they
finally concluded that he had been kept by the
violent storm and had taken shelter somewhere.
When the servants on the watch for his return
caught sight of him they called to every one that
he was approaching, and the whole household
turned out to meet him, wondering much what
the retinue of men, bearing presents and banners,
that followed him, could mean.</p>

<p>As soon as the Dragon King&#8217;s retainers had
put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato
told all that had happened to him.</p>

<p>The presents which he had received from the
grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic
power. The bell only was ordinary, and as
Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to
the temple near by, where it was hung up, to
boom out the hour of day over the surrounding
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The single bag of rice, however much was
taken from it day after day for the meals of the
knight and his whole family, never grew less&mdash;the
supply in the bag was inexhaustible.</p>

<p>The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter,
though time after time long pieces were cut off
to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go
to Court in at the New Year.</p>

<p>The cooking pot was wonderful, too. No matter
what was put into it, it cooked deliciously
whatever was wanted without any firing&mdash;truly
a very economical saucepan.</p>

<p>The fame of Hidesato&#8217;s fortune spread far
and wide, and as there was no need for him to
spend money on rice or silk or firing, he became
very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth
known as <em>My Lord Bag of Rice</em>.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE HARE OF OKI</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Japanese Fairy Tale</em></p>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY B. M. BURRELL</strong></p>


<p>Alice lived in New York, but she still had the
nurse who had taken care of her when she was
a tiny baby in far-away Japan. Nurse wore the
picturesque kimono and obi of her native land,
and looked so different from other people that
friends often wondered how Alice could feel at
home with her. Love, however, is the same the
world over, and no one loved Alice better than
did her little Japanese nurse.</p>

<p>When Papa and Mama were at dinner, and
Alice and Nurse had the library all to themselves
till bedtime, the little girl would often pull two
chairs up to the fire and say coaxingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is just time for a story!&rdquo; And Nurse
would smile her funny Japanese smile and begin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long, long ago, when the great Japanese gods
ruled from high heaven,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the beginning Alice liked best, for it
meant that a fairy tale would follow. And Nurse
would perhaps continue:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;a little hare lived on the island of Oki. It
was a beautiful island, but the hare was not satisfied:
he wished to get to the mainland. He did
not know how to manage this; but one day he
thought of a plan. Hopping down to the shore,
he waited till a crocodile came out to sun himself,
then opened a conversation with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are, I suppose, many crocodiles in the
sea,&rsquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Many, many!&rsquo; the crocodile answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so many, however, as there are hares
on the island of Oki,&rsquo; returned the little hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The crocodiles in the sea outnumber the hares
of Oki as the drops in the sea outnumber the
trees of the island,&rsquo; declared the crocodile, in his
deepest voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It does not seem right for a little bit of a
creature like myself to differ with your lordship,&rsquo;
said the hare, politely, &lsquo;but I should like to see
a proof of your statement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How can we prove it?&rsquo; the crocodile questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can call all your friends and place them
from here to the mainland, each with his nose on
the tail of the neighbor before him; then I can
easily jump from one to the other, counting as I
go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crocodile agreed to this plan, thinking it
a good one. &lsquo;But how can we count the hares?&rsquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That we will decide after I have numbered
the crocodiles,&rsquo; the hare suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crocodile was satisfied, and bade the hare
come to the same place next morning to do the
counting. Of course the little animal was on
hand bright and early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There stretched an unbroken line of crocodiles,
a floating bridge to the mainland!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little hare lost no time hopping across it,
you may be sure. As he reached the last crocodile
and prepared to jump to shore, his heart was
so full of pride at the success of his ruse that he
could not resist crying aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How I have fooled you big creatures! I
wished for a bridge to the mainland, and you
have served my need!&rsquo; Then he jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last crocodile opened his wide jaws and
closed them again with a snap. The hare was
too quick to be caught, but the monster&#8217;s teeth
touched him and tore off most of his fur! As the
poor thing limped away, a crocodile called after
him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You see what happens when you trifle with
creatures stronger than yourself!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little hare did not know much, but he felt
that he was learning. He had no heart to explore
the beauties of the mainland now, but crawled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
under a bush by the roadside and wished that
some one would tell him how to cure his wounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After some time he heard the noise of many
people on the road. He crept out to see what
was coming, and beheld a crowd of young men,
carrying burdens as if they were on a journey.
They were all tall and handsome, and wore beautiful
clothes fit for princes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them spied the little hare and cried:
&lsquo;Well, friend, why do you look so sad?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hare, proud of being called &lsquo;friend&rsquo; by
this fine gentleman, told how he had deceived the
crocodiles. The men laughed loudly, and one of
them said: &lsquo;Since you are so clever, it is strange
that you do not know the best way to cure your
wounds. You should bathe in the salt sea, and
then climb a hill so that the Wind Goddess can
blow upon you with her cool breath.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">the princess and the hare</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little hare thanked the strangers for their
advice, and then asked them where they were
journeying. They replied that they were eighty-one
princes, all wishing to marry the princess
of that country. She was very rich, and the
responsibility of managing her wealth and kingdom
was too much for her; so she had given
notice that she desired to marry a wise and noble
prince whom she could trust to rule for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So wealth and power do not always bring
content?&rsquo; the hare questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They would content us!&rsquo; the eighty princes
answered. (The eighty-first was not present.
He was of a kindly and gentle disposition, which
caused his brothers to laugh at and impose upon
him. To-day they had given him most of the
luggage to carry, so he could not walk as fast as
they.) As they started on the way, one of the
princes called to the hare: &lsquo;Good-by! And don&#8217;t
forget to bathe your wounds in the salt sea!&rsquo;
And with loud laughter they continued their
journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little hare did not give himself time to
forget. He hurried to the shore and let the waves
roll over him, but instead of making him feel
better, the biting salt water only increased his
pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must hurry to the Wind Goddess,&rsquo; the
poor hare thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He climbed the high hill with difficulty and lay
down on the top, hoping for relief from his suffering.
But the stiff grass pricked his wounds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and the biting wind caused them to throb more
painfully. At last he realized that the cruel
princes had deceived him, and he crawled back to
his bush by the roadside, where he lay with closed
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentle voice roused him. &lsquo;Who has wounded
you, little hare?&rsquo; it asked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img337.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the good-natured prince and the princess</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&ldquo;The little hare looked up and saw a beautiful
youth standing beside him. His experience with
men made him think that it would be best to fly
from the stranger; but the young man&#8217;s kind
glance conquered his fear, and he answered: &lsquo;I
left the island of Oki to see the wonders of the
mainland, and I have fared badly from the exchange.&rsquo;
Then he told once more how he had left
the island, and also about the bad advice the
eighty princes had given him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young man sighed. &lsquo;They used you ill,
little creature,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You learned that it is
foolish to meddle with beings stronger than yourself;
now you see how wicked it is to torment
those weaker. My brother princes should have
told you to bathe in the fresh water of the river
and to lie on the soft rushes. Now, good-by, little
friend. May good luck attend you!&rsquo; And he
walked quietly away, bending beneath the large
burden he carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little hare knew that the stranger was the
eighty-first of the princes, and so for a time,
he feared to follow his advice. But he was in
such pain that he decided to go to the river,
which flowed like a silver ribbon through the
fields toward the ocean. Into the cool water he
plunged and immediately felt better, as the sand
and bitter salt of the sea were washed from his
wounds. Then he took a nap on the soft rushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he awoke he no longer was in pain, so
he was filled with gratitude toward the young
prince who had given him such kind and wise
advice. He sat up, feeling quite strong again,
and tried to think of a way in which he could
repay his benefactor. In the distance he saw the
roofs of the princess&#8217;s palace rising among the
trees which surrounded it. This gave him an
idea, and he lost no time in carrying it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Across the fields he hopped toward the palace,
never stopping till he reached the garden wall.
He crept in under the high gate, and there stood
the princess under a cherry-tree covered with
blossoms. The little hare went up to her and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
said respectfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gracious Princess, I bring to you advice, if
you will accept it from so insignificant a person
as I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Speak, little hare,&rsquo; the beautiful princess answered,
for she knew that the best things are
often found in unexpected places, and things are
not always what they seem to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Eighty princes are coming to-day as suitors
for your hand. They are dressed in rich and
beautiful robes, and their faces are gay and smiling;
but all that is only to hide the cruelty of
their hearts. Following them is a young man
who is as wise as he is kind and gentle. Turn
the eighty from your gate, but honor the youngest
suitor as greater than they.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know all this?&rsquo; the princess
questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the little hare told his story for the third
time, speaking so earnestly that the princess
could not fail to be impressed by it. She thanked
him for his advice, and after giving him some
tender leaves to eat, prepared to receive the
eighty-one brothers. They came a few minutes
later, resplendent in the magnificent clothes they
had put on in the princess&#8217;s honor. Indeed, they
all looked so handsome that she found it hard to
believe the story of their cruelty. While they
were talking of their journey to her kingdom, however,
some of the princes told how they had made
sport of a little hare too stupid to know that salt
was not the best thing for open wounds, and she
noticed that the youngest brother was the only
one who did not enjoy the story. At this, rage
filled her gentle heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Turn out the eighty princes!&rsquo; she cried to
her attendants; &lsquo;no one who is cruel to so small a
creature as a little hare is fit to rule over a kingdom.
But with you,&rsquo; she added, turning to the
youngest prince, &lsquo;will I share my throne, for you
are a wise and merciful man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure the youngest prince was
happy to hear that, for, after once seeing the
beautiful princess, the thought of parting from
her was like lead in his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the cruel brothers were drummed out of
the palace with shouts of scorn; but the gentle
prince and princess went into the garden to thank
the little hare. They could not find him, however,
search as they would; for as soon as he
learned of the success of his plan, he had hopped
away to see the world, wiser for his day&#8217;s experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Alice asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; Nurse answered. &ldquo;And now it
is time for you to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

 And she hummed a queer little Chinese tune with a Chinese tra-la-la!<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was all that she had to do</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To keep her from feeling blue,</span><br />
 For terribly lonely and dull sometimes was poor little Loo-lee Loo.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her father had kites to fly</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far up in the free blue sky</span><br />
 (For a Chinaman loves with this elegant sport his leisure to occupy);<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And what with his drums and gongs,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his numerous loud ding-dongs,</span><br />
 He could have any day, in a princely way, a regular Fourth of July.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her mother, the fair Su-See,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was as busy as she could be,</span><br />
 Though she never went out, except, perhaps, to a neighboring afternoon tea;<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">She was young herself, as yet,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the minutes that she could get</span><br />
 She spent in studying up the rules of Elegant Etiquette.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So the princess nibbled her plums,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And twirled her dear little thumbs,</span><br />
 And lent sometimes a wistful ear to the beating of distant drums;<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Until one April day&mdash;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>Tsing Ming</em>, as they would say&mdash;</span><br />
 She saw at the gate a sight that straight took Loo-lee&#8217;s breath away.</p>

     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">A fan in his princely hand,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which he waved with a gesture bland</span><br />
 (Instead of a gentleman&#8217;s walking-stick it was carried, you understand),<br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In splendor of girdle and shoe,</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a glitter of gold and of blue,</span><br />
 With the fair Su-See at his side came he, the lordly Prince Choo-Choo.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The princess bent her brow</span><br />
     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a truly celestial bow,</span><br />
 Saluted her father with filial grace, and made him the grand kotow.<br />

 (That sounds very much like a Chinese word, and expresses his feelings, too!)<br />

 On having her way till she quite forgot her daughterly etiquette.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1.7em;">&ldquo;Oh, what do I care!&rdquo; she said.</span><br />

     <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then the prince he called for lights,</span><br />

<h2>THE JACKAL AND THE CAMEL</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Hindu Tale</em></p>


<p>The Jackal stood looking across the river where
the crabs lay in the sun on the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Jackal, &ldquo;if I could only swim,
how good those crabs would be! I wish I had
a boat or a canoe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the Camel came out of the woods.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Jackal, &ldquo;if I can only get the
Camel to take me across the river! I can ride
high up on his hump, and it will be just as good
as a boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, friend,&rdquo; said the Jackal to the
Camel. &ldquo;Are you hungry? I know a place
where the sugar cane grows higher and sweeter
than anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; cried the Camel. &ldquo;Tell
me, and I will go there at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could take you to the place,&rdquo; said the Jackal,
&ldquo;but it is across the river, and I cannot swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Camel, &ldquo;that is all right. Get
up on my back and I will take you across, and
you can show me where the sugar cane is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Jackal, &ldquo;and I will look
along the bank of the river and see if I can find
any fat crabs on that side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump up quickly,&rdquo; said the Camel, &ldquo;it makes
me hungry just to think of sugar cane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Jackal jumped up on the Camel&#8217;s back,
and the Camel swam across the river, and the
Jackal did not get the least bit wet, even the tip
of his tail. (The Jackal does not like to get
even the tip of his tail wet.)</p>

<p>When they were across the river the Camel
went off to the patch of sugar cane, and the
Jackal ate the crabs which lay out in the sun
on the sand. It was not long until he had eaten
as many crabs as he could, and wanted to go back
to the other side of the river. So he went to
where the Camel stood in the cane patch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, have you finished your crabs?&rdquo; asked
the Camel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I cannot eat another one. Let us go
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Camel, &ldquo;I have hardly begun to
eat yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Jackal, &ldquo;I will go out
to the edge of the patch and lie down and wait
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Jackal did not lie down. He was in
a hurry to go home, now that he had eaten all
the crabs he wanted. So he said: &ldquo;I do not want
to wait here. I know a little song I can sing
that will make that Camel hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he began to sing. Of course, the Camel
did not pay any attention, but the farmer heard,
as the Jackal knew he would, and came running
out with sticks to chase the Jackal. But the
Jackal hid in the high cane, and the farmer
could not find him. He did find the Camel, however,
and called to his boys, and they beat the
Camel with sticks and drove him out of the
cane.</p>

<p>When the farmer and his boys had gone, the
Jackal came out of the cane and found the Camel
lying on the sand bruised with the beating he had
gotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;where have you
been? I have been hunting for you in the cane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not call me friend,&rdquo; said the Camel. &ldquo;Why
did you sing that song that made the farmer come
out and beat me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Jackal, &ldquo;did the farmer come
out and beat you? That is too bad. But I always
sing a song after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, do you?&rdquo; said the Camel. &ldquo;I did not know
that. Very well. Let us go home. Climb up
while I am lying down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Jackal climbed upon the Camel&#8217;s back,
and he entered the water and began to swim across
the river, the Jackal riding high on the hump of
the camel so as not to get wet, even to the tip
of his tail.</p>

<p>When they were about the middle of the stream
the Camel said: &ldquo;I believe that I shall roll over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not do that,&rdquo; exclaimed the Jackal, &ldquo;for I
shall get wet and be drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will,&rdquo; said the Camel; &ldquo;but you see
I always roll over after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he rolled over in the water, and the Jackal
got wet&mdash;first the tip of his tail, and then all
over, and was drowned.</p>

<h2><a name="HASHNU" id="HASHNU"></a>HASHNU THE STONECUTTER</h2>

<p class="center"><em>A Japanese Story</em></p>


<p>Hashnu the Stonecutter sat beside the highway
cutting stone. It was hard work, and the
sun shone hot upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; said Hashnu, &ldquo;if one only did not
have to work all day. I would that I could sit
and rest, and not have to ply this heavy mallet.</p>

<p>Just then there was a great commotion, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Hashnu saw a crowd of people coming up the
road. When they drew nearer he noticed that
one of them was the King. On his right side
rode soldiers, all arrayed in armor and ready to
do his bidding, while on the left rode courtiers,
seeking to serve him and win his favor.</p>

<p>And Hashnu, watching, thought what a fine
thing it would be to be a King, and to have soldiers
to do his bidding, and courtiers to serve
him, and he said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah me, ah me,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">If Hashnu only a King could be.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>At once he heard a voice say: &ldquo;Be thou the
King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then in a moment Hashnu found that he was
no longer the stonecutter, sitting beside the highway
with a heavy mallet in his hand, but the
King, dressed in armor, riding in the midst of
soldiers and courtiers, and all about him doing
homage.</p>

<p>He rode very proudly for a while, and his subjects
bowed low before him. But the armor was
heavy, and the helmet pressed hard upon his
brow, and his head throbbed with the weight of
it. He was indeed weary and faint with the
heat, because, though a King, the sun beat hot
upon him!</p>

<p>And he said to himself: &ldquo;Lo, I am the King,
and yet the sun can make me faint and weary.
I had thought that to be a King was to be
stronger than anything else, but the sun is
stronger than the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as they rode further, and the sun still
beat hard upon him, he said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah me, ah me,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">If Hashnu only the sun could be!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Then he heard a voice say: &ldquo;Be thou the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment he was no longer the King,
riding among his courtiers, but the sun, blazing
high in the heavens, shining hot upon the fields
and the meadows. As he did not know how to
shine, he allowed his rays to fall too fiercely upon
the world, and grass and grain were dried up
and withered, and men lamented because of the
cruelty of the heat. But Hashnu thought he
was doing great things, and was very proud,
until a cloud came between him and the earth,
so that his rays no longer fell upon the fields
and the cities of men.</p>

<p>And Hashnu said: &ldquo;Lo, I am the sun, and my
rays fell upon the fields and the cities, and all
acknowledge my power. But the cloud is
stronger than the sun, for it shuts off my rays
from the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, because the cloud would not go, but became
heavier and blacker, Hashnu lamented, and
said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah me, ah me,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">If Hashnu only the cloud could be.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And in a moment he was no longer the sun,
shining fiercely upon the earth, but the cloud,
riding in the sky, shutting off the rays of the
sun, and pouring rain upon the fields and the
meadows, filling the rivers and the streams to
overflowing. But he did not know how to let
down the rain wisely, and it fell too heavily, and
the rivers rose high and destroyed the fields and
the cities, and the meadows were turned into
swamps, and the grain rotted in the ground, and
the wind blew, and trees were uprooted, and
houses fell before it. But Hashnu cared for none
of these things, for he thought he was doing
very finely indeed.</p>

<p>But as he looked down upon the earth he saw
that a rock beside the highway stood unmoved
and firm, for all of his raining and blowing. And
he said: &ldquo;For all I am strong, and can blow
down trees and destroy cities, and can pour my
waters upon the earth and flood the fields and the
meadows, yet does that rock defy my power. I,
Hashnu, would be stronger than the rock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the rock was unchanged, and Hashnu, lamenting,
said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah me, ah me,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">If Hashnu only the rock could be!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Then he heard a voice say: &ldquo;Be thou the
rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment he was no longer the cloud,
with the wind blowing hard, and pouring water
upon the earth, but the rock, fixed and unmoved
beside the highway. Now, at last, he felt that
he was stronger than all. But even as he rejoiced,
he felt the sharp point of a stonecutter&#8217;s
chisel, and heard the sound of his heavy mallet
striking upon its head. Then he knew that,
though the water had fallen upon the rock and
been unable to change it, and the wind had blown
hard against it and had no effect, yet would the
stonecutter change and alter it, and make it take
whatever shape he desired. And he said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Ah me, ah me,<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">If Hashnu only the stonecutter could be!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>And he heard a voice say: &ldquo;Be thou thyself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hashnu found himself again sitting beside
the highway with a chisel in his hand, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
a mallet on the ground beside him, and the rock
before him. And the King had gone by, and the
rays of the sun were now shadowed by the
cloud, from which no rain fell, but only a grateful
shade. And Hashnu said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun was stronger than the King, the
cloud was stronger than the sun, the rock was
stronger than the cloud, but I, Hashnu, am
stronger than all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he worked on, now well content to do
each day his added task.</p>

<h2><a name="BRAHMAN" id="BRAHMAN"></a>THE TIGER, THE BRAHMAN, AND THE JACKAL<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></h2>


<p>Once upon a time a Tiger was caught in a trap.
He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and
rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed.</p>

<p>By chance a poor Brahman came by. &ldquo;Let
me out of this cage, oh, pious one!&rdquo; cried the
Tiger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my friend,&rdquo; replied the Brahman, mildly;
&ldquo;you would probably eat me if I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; declared the Tiger; &ldquo;on the contrary,
I should be forever grateful, and serve you
as a slave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, when the Tiger sobbed, and sighed, and
wept, and swore, the pious Brahman&#8217;s heart softened;
and at last he consented to open the door
of the cage. Out popped the Tiger, and, seizing
the poor man, cried: &ldquo;What a fool you are!
What is to prevent my eating you now, for after
being cooped up so long I am just terribly
hungry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the
most he could gain was a promise to abide by the
decision of the first three things he chose to
question as to the justice of the Tiger&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>So the Brahman asked first a Pipal Tree what
it thought of the matter; but the Pipal Tree replied
coldly: &ldquo;What have you to complain about?
Don&#8217;t I give shade and shelter to every one who
passes by, and don&#8217;t they in return tear down my
branches to feed their cattle? Don&#8217;t whimper&mdash;be
a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went farther
afield till he saw a Buffalo turning a well-wheel;
but he fared no better from it, for it answered:
&ldquo;You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at
me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed
and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke
me here, and give me refuse as fodder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brahman, still more sad, asked the Road
to give him its opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the Road, &ldquo;how foolish you
are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful
to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and
small, trample on me as they go past, giving me
nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the
husks of their grain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully,
and on the way he met a Jackal, who called out:
&ldquo;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Brahman? You
look as miserable as a fish out of water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brahman told him all that had occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very confusing!&rdquo; said the Jackal, when
the recital was ended; &ldquo;would you mind telling
me again, for everything has got so mixed up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Brahman told it all over again, but the
Jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of
way, and still could not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very odd,&rdquo; said he, sadly, &ldquo;but it all seems
to go in at one ear and out of the other! I will
go to the place where it all happened, and then
perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they returned to the cage, by which the
Tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening
his teeth and claws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&#8217;ve been away a long time!&rdquo; growled the
savage beast, &ldquo;but now let us begin our dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our dinner!&rdquo; thought the wretched Brahman,
as his knees knocked together with fright; &ldquo;what
a remarkably delicate way of putting it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me five minutes, my lord!&rdquo; he pleaded,
&ldquo;in order that I may explain matters to the Jackal
here, who is somewhat slow in his wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tiger consented, and the Brahman began
the whole story over again, not missing a single
detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!&rdquo; cried
the Jackal, wringing its paws. &ldquo;Let me see!
How did it all begin? You were in the cage,
and the Tiger came walking by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; interrupted the Tiger, &ldquo;what a fool
you are! I was in the cage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried the Jackal, pretending to
tremble with fright; &ldquo;yes! I was in the cage&mdash;no
I wasn&#8217;t&mdash;dear! dear! where are my wits?
Let me see&mdash;the Tiger was in the Brahman, and
the cage came walking by&mdash;no, that&#8217;s not it,
either! Well, don&#8217;t mind me, but begin your
dinner, for I shall never understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall!&rdquo; returned the Tiger, in a
rage at the Jackal&#8217;s stupidity; &ldquo;I&#8217;ll make you
understand! Look here! I am the Tiger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
&ldquo;And that is the Brahman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is the cage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I was in the cage&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no! Please, my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried the Tiger, impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, my lord!&mdash;how did you get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How!&mdash;why in the usual way, of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me!&mdash;my head is beginning to whirl
again! Please don&#8217;t be angry, my lord, but what
is the usual way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the Tiger lost patience, and, jumping
into the cage, cried: &ldquo;This way! Now do you
understand how it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly!&rdquo; grinned the Jackal, as he dexterously
shut the door, &ldquo;and if you will permit me
to say so, I think matters will remain as they
were!&rdquo;</p></div>

<h2><a name="WILLOW" id="WILLOW"></a>THE STORY OF THE WILLOW PATTERN PLATE</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY M. ALSTON BUCKLEY</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in China a rich
and haughty mandarin, who had great riches in
lands, and horses, and priceless jewels. This great
man had one lovely daughter with soft black eyes,
and raven hair that scarcely could be told in
texture from the silken robes she wore. The
mandarin loved his daughter and showered dazzling
jewels on her, and bought rich robes, heavy
with choicest needlework, that she might wear
them.</p>

<p>Now the mandarin had a faithful secretary, a
young man named Chang, whose every thought
was given to the business of the man he served.
But as he went about the house with downcast
eyes, Chang saw the daughter of the mandarin
trip lightly to her father&#8217;s side to whisper in the
ear of her indulgent parent, or flash across the
hall, or through the garden where she fed her
goldfish in the lake, and when her mother called
her name, Kong Lee, it seemed to him like sounds
of liquid music. The mandarin talked always
of his secretary, and said that he was honest
and true and good, and told the truth and did his
work as well as ever any man could do it.</p>

<p>Kong Lee learned to think of him and love
him.</p>

<p>But the mandarin had a friend, a rich old man,
who wished to marry Kong Lee, and take her
far away to be the mistress of his castle. Kong
Lee refused to marry this old man, and to punish
her, her father shut her up in the top room
of a lonely house that stood on the lake shore.
From her windows she could see the lake, and
she could see the willow tree that dipped its
drooping branches in the smooth, still water and
seemed to hang its head and weep for her. And
when the Spring came on and she could hear
the singing of the birds, she wished that she could
go and walk about the garden where she could
see the sweet blossoms that hung like a veil of
pink over the peach trees. In her loneliness she
wept, and wrote sad poetry, which she threw into
the water.</p>

<p>All this time Chang grieved for her, and sent
her gifts to comfort her, and when his work
was done, he walked along the shore and thought
of her. But one day Kong Lee caught sight of
him standing on the shore, and she thought,
&ldquo;Chang will help me.&rdquo; So she took a cocoanut,
and cut the shell in two and made a little boat
of half of it. Then she made a little sail of fine,
carved ivory, on the sail she wrote a message
asking Chang to help her and threw the boat out
of the window. The little skiff sailed out over
the lake, then fell and splashed into the water,
the wind caught the sail and the small craft sailed
bravely on. Chang saw it, waded out, and caught
it, read the message, and went to find Kong Lee.</p>

<p>Kong Lee was waiting for him, and they fled
in haste, taking her box of jewels with them.
The mandarin saw them, and taking a whip he
hastened after them to beat them back again, for
he had great fear of his friend&#8217;s anger. But
they were too swift for him, and reached the
other side, where Chang&#8217;s boat was waiting to
take them to his house.</p>

<p>There they were married, and lived in happiness
until the mandarin&#8217;s wicked friend found
where they were, and secretly, at night, sailed
down the lake and burned the house when they
were sleeping. But their loving spirits became
two doves that rested in the trees and flew about
the places they had loved.</p>

<p>And if you look at a blue china plate you will
see there the house where Kong Lee was shut
up, the willow tree she watched, Kong Lee and
Chang running across the bridge followed by her
father with his whip, the funny house-boat that
carried them away to Chang&#8217;s little house that
almost is hidden by the trees, and at the top, the
pair of doves in which the Chinese poet believed
the spirits of Kong Lee and Chang still lived.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>TRANSLATED BY JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS</strong></p>


<p>Once upon a time Brother Fox and Brother
Rabbit lived near each other in the woods. But
they had to go a long way each morning to get
water from a spring.</p>

<p>One day Brother Fox said to Brother Rabbit:
&ldquo;What&#8217;s the use of taking a long walk every
morning. Let us dig a well of our own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall no longer go to the spring,&rdquo; said
Brother Rabbit. &ldquo;From this time on I shall
drink the dew from the grass and the flowers.
Why should I work to dig a well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit knew by the way Brother Fox
talked that he was going to dig the well anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said Brother Fox. &ldquo;Then
I will dig the well myself. And I will drink the
water all by myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Brother Fox began to dig
a well by a big tree. He worked, and worked,
and worked. Brother Rabbit was hiding in a
bush near by and watching Brother Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;How foolish
Brother Fox is! I guess I shall soon have all
the water I want. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, while Brother Fox was asleep,
Brother Rabbit stole quietly down to the well
by the big tree, and drank and laughed, and drank
and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I can have all the water I want,&rdquo; said
Brother Rabbit. &ldquo;Brother Fox was foolish to
do all the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, when Brother Fox went to get
some water, he saw rabbit tracks in the mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha! Brother Rabbit,&rdquo; said Brother Fox
to himself, &ldquo;so that&#8217;s the way you drink the dew
from the grass and the flowers! Well, well, I
think I can catch you at your trick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brother Fox ran home as fast as he could and
made a great big doll of wood, as big as a baby.
He covered the wooden doll with black, sticky tar.
Then he put a little cap on its head. At sunset,
he put the tar baby out beside the well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I shall get Brother Rabbit this time,&rdquo;
he said, as he went home laughing to himself all
the way.</p>

<p>Soon Brother Rabbit came hopping through
the bushes. He looked first this way, then that.
The least noise frightened him. When he saw
the tar baby, he sat up straight and peeped at it
through the leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, there! Who are you?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, I say?&rdquo; he asked in a louder tone.</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>Then Brother Rabbit went right up close to
the tar baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&#8217;t you answer me?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Have you no tongue?
Speak, or I&#8217;ll hit you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit raised his right hand and&mdash;biff!
his hand stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! What&#8217;s this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let me go,
or I&#8217;ll hit you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>At that&mdash;blip! he hit the tar baby with the
other hand. That stuck fast, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, you rascal!&rdquo; cried Brother Rabbit.
&ldquo;If you don&#8217;t let me go, I&#8217;ll kick you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>Bim! Brother Rabbit&#8217;s right foot stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, you imp!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;If I kick
you with my left foot, you&#8217;ll think the world has
come to an end!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>Bom! the left foot stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, now!&rdquo; Brother Rabbit screamed.
&ldquo;Let me loose, or I&#8217;ll butt you into the well with
my head! Let me go, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tar baby said nothing.</p>

<p>Buff! Brother Rabbit&#8217;s head stuck fast.</p>

<p>And there was Brother Rabbit with both hands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
and both feet, and his head stuck fast.</p>

<p>The next morning Brother Fox came out to
see how the tar baby was getting along. He saw
Brother Rabbit, and he laughed to himself until
his sides ached.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Brother Rabbit!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;What are
you doing? How do you like my tar baby? I
thought you drank dew from the grass and the
flowers! I have you now, Brother Rabbit, I
have you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go, Brother Fox!&rdquo; cried Brother Rabbit.
&ldquo;Let me go! I am your friend. Don&#8217;t hurt me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend? You are a thief,&rdquo; said Brother Fox.
&ldquo;Who wants a thief for a friend?&rdquo; Then he
ran quickly to his home in the woods and built
a big fire.</p>

<p>Soon Brother Fox tore Brother Rabbit loose
from the tar baby, threw him over his shoulder,
and started for the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roast rabbit is good,&rdquo; said Brother Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roast me! Burn me! Anything!&rdquo; said
Brother Rabbit, &ldquo;Only don&#8217;t throw me into the
brier patch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve a mind to throw you into the well,&rdquo; said
Brother Fox, as he turned and looked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drown me! Kill me! Anything! Only
don&#8217;t throw me into the brier patch,&rdquo; said Brother
Rabbit. &ldquo;The briers will tear my flesh and
scratch my eyes out. Throw me into the fire!
Throw me into the well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha, Brother Rabbit!&rdquo; said Brother Fox.
&ldquo;So you don&#8217;t like briers? Then here you go!&rdquo;
and he threw Brother Rabbit away over into the
brier patch.</p>

<p>As soon as Brother Rabbit touched the ground,
he sat up and laughed, and laughed, and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! Brother Fox!&rdquo; said Brother
Rabbit. &ldquo;Thank you, dear Brother Fox, thank
you! I was born and reared in a brier patch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Brother Rabbit ran off in great glee,
chuckling over the trick he had played on Brother
Fox.</p></div>

<h2><a name="PEAS" id="PEAS"></a>THE RABBIT AND THE PEAS</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MRS. M. R. ALLEN</strong></p>


<p>A long time ago there was a Bear that had a
fine pea patch. He and his wife had to work in
the field every day, so they left their little girl
at home to keep house. One fine morning Br&#8217;er
(which means &ldquo;Brother&rdquo;) Rabbit came up to the
house and called the little girl: &ldquo;Mary, Mary,
your father and mother told me to come up here
and tell you to put me in the pea patch and let
me have as many peas as I want.&rdquo; So Mary
put him in, and he stayed there until nearly 12
o&#8217;clock, and then he begun calling: &ldquo;Little girl,
little girl, come and let me out; I&#8217;m full for this
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she let him out, and he went home. At
dinner when her father and mother came home
and saw their pea patch they were angry, and
said: &ldquo;Who has been in these peas?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,
didn&#8217;t you send Br&#8217;er Rabbit to get as many
as he wanted?&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;No, I didn&#8217;t; no,
I didn&#8217;t;&rdquo; said Mr. Bear. &ldquo;And the next time
that rascal comes here with that sort of tale,
you just keep him in there until I come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the next morning Br&#8217;er Rabbit came back
again, and called: &ldquo;Mary, Mary, your father
told me to tell you to put me in the pea patch,
and let me have all the peas I want.&rdquo; &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;come on.&rdquo; So she put him
in and fastened him up.</p>

<p>As it began to grow late, Mr. Rabbit began
to call: &ldquo;Little girl, little girl, come and let me
out!&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;when I put
down my bread for supper.&rdquo; After a while he
called again: &ldquo;Little girl, little girl, come let me
out!&rdquo; &ldquo;When I milk my cow,&rdquo; said Mary.
When she finished milking he called again, and
she said: &ldquo;Wait till I turn my cow out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time Mr. Bear came home and found
him in his pea patch, and asked him what he was
doing in there. &ldquo;Your little girl told me you
said I might have some peas,&rdquo; said Br&#8217;er Rabbit.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Bear, &ldquo;I&#8217;ll put you in
this box until I get rested and eat my supper,
then I&#8217;ll show you a trick or two.&rdquo; So he locked
him in the box and went to the house.</p>

<p>After a while Br&#8217;er Fox came along the road,
and Br&#8217;er Rabbit called him, and Br&#8217;er Fox said:
&ldquo;What are you doing in there?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are
going to have a ball here to-night and want me
to play the fiddle for them, so they put me in
here. I wouldn&#8217;t disappoint them,&rdquo; said Br&#8217;er
Rabbit. &ldquo;But, Br&#8217;er Fox, you always could
beat me playing the fiddle. Now, they offer to
pay two dollars for every tune. Suppose you
take my place; my wife is sick and I must go
home&mdash;if I can get off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. &ldquo;I&#8217;m always willing
to make money, and if you don&#8217;t want to
stay I will take your place.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;who are you, i say?&rdquo; he asked in a louder voice</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look on top of the box and get the key.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
I saw Mr. Bear put it there,&rdquo; said Br&#8217;er Rabbit.
So Br&#8217;er Fox unlocked the door, and Br&#8217;er Rabbit
hopped out and locked Br&#8217;er Fox in.</p>

<p>So after supper they all came out, and the little
girl ran up to the box and looked in, and said:
&ldquo;Oh, mamma! just come and see how this Rabbit
has growed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Fox said: &ldquo;I ain&#8217;t no Rabbit!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said Mr. Bear, &ldquo;how came you in there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because
Br&#8217;er Rabbit asked me to take his place,
and play at your ball to-night,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Br&#8217;er Rabbit has fooled you badly, Fox.
But I will have to whip you, anyway, for letting
him out. I&#8217;ll help you find Br&#8217;er Rabbit.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&#8217;ll
hunt him till I die, to pay him back for fooling
me so,&rdquo; said Mr. Fox. So they all started out
to find Br&#8217;er Rabbit.</p>

<p>And they soon came upon him, and he began
to run, and all of them after him. And they got
him in a tight place, and he ran up a hollow
tree.</p>

<p>And they had to go back for their axes. So
they put a Frog at the tree to watch him to keep
him from getting away. After they were gone,
Mr. Frog looked up and saw Br&#8217;er Rabbit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">they had to go look for axes.<br />
so they put a frog at the tree to watch</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s dat you chewing?&rdquo; said Mr. Frog.
&ldquo;Tobacco,&rdquo; said Br&#8217;er Rabbit. &ldquo;Give me some,&rdquo;
said Mr. Frog. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Br&#8217;er Rabbit, &ldquo;look
up here and open your eyes and mouth wide.&rdquo;
So he filled the Frog&#8217;s eyes full of trash. And
while Mr. Frog was rubbing his eyes trying to
get the trash out so he could see, Br&#8217;er Rabbit
ran out and got away.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bear and Mr. Fox got back with
their axes, they asked Mr. Frog: &ldquo;Whar&#8217;s Mr.
Rabbit?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;He&#8217;s in dar.&rdquo; They cut
down the tree and didn&#8217;t find him. Then they
asked Mr. Frog again: &ldquo;Whar&#8217;s Mr. Rabbit?&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&#8217;s in dar,&rdquo; said Mr. Frog. So they split
the tree open, and still didn&#8217;t find him. And they
asked Mr. Frog again, &ldquo;Whar&#8217;s Mr. Rabbit, I
say?&rdquo; &ldquo;He&#8217;s in dar,&rdquo; said Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Frog,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you have let
Mr. Rabbit get away, and we are going to kill
you in his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Mr. Frog said: &ldquo;Wait till I go to my praying
ground, and say my prayers.&rdquo; So they told
him he might have five minutes.</p>

<p>And there was a pond near by, and a log on
the edge of it. So when Frog got on the log he
bowed his head and said: &ldquo;Ta-hoo! ta-hoo! ta-h-o-o!&rdquo;
Splash! and he was gone! And the
Bear and Fox were outwitted again.</p>

<h2>BR&#8217;ER RABBIT&#8217;S FISHING<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></h2>


<p>One day, Br&#8217;er Rabbit, and Br&#8217;er Fox, and
Br&#8217;er Bear, and Br&#8217;er Coon, and all the rest of
them were clearing up a new piece of ground
to plant some corn.</p>

<p>The sun got sort of hot, and Br&#8217;er Rabbit he
got tired; but he didn&#8217;t say so, &#8217;cause he &#8217;fraid
the others&#8217;d call him lazy, so he kept on clearing
away the rubbish and piling it up, till by-and-by
he holler out that he got a thorn in his hand.
Then he took and slipped off, and hunted for a
cool place to rest in.</p>

<p>After a while Br&#8217;er Rabbit he see a well, with
a bucket hanging in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That looks cool,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Rabbit, says he,
&ldquo;and cool I &#8217;spects it is. I&#8217;ll just about get in
there and take a nap,&rdquo; says he. And with that
in he jumped.</p>

<p>No sooner was Br&#8217;er Rabbit in, than the bucket
began to go down, and there was no wusser scared
beast since the world began than this here Br&#8217;er
Rabbit was <em>then</em>. He fairly shook with fright.
He know where he come from, but he dunno
where he going. Presently he feel the bucket hit
the water, and there it sat. Br&#8217;er Rabbit he keep
mighty still, &#8217;cause he dunno what be going to
happen next. He just lay there, and shook and
shivered.</p>

<p>Now, Br&#8217;er Fox he always kep&#8217; one eye on
Br&#8217;er Rabbit and, when Br&#8217;er Rabbit slipped off
the new ground, Br&#8217;er Fox he sneaked after him.
He knew Br&#8217;er Rabbit was after something or
other, and he took and crept off to watch him.
Br&#8217;er Fox see Br&#8217;er Rabbit come to the well
and stop, and then he see him jump into the
bucket, and then, lo and behold, he see him go
down out of sight.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox was the most astonished fox that
ever you set eyes on. He sat off there in the
bushes, and he think and think, but he make no
heads or tails of this kind of business. Then he
says to himself, says he:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if this don&#8217;t beat my times,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;then Joe&#8217;s dead and Sal&#8217;s a widder,&rdquo; says he.
&ldquo;Right down there in that well Br&#8217;er Rabbit keeps
his money hid, and if it ain&#8217;t that, then he&#8217;s
been and gone and discovered a gold mine; and
if it ain&#8217;t that, then I&#8217;m a-going to see what
<em>is</em> there,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox crept up a little nigher, he did, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
he listen, but he hear nothing, and he kept on
getting nigher, and yet he hear nothing. By-and-by
he get up close. He peep down; he see nothing,
and he hear nothing.</p>

<p>All this while Br&#8217;er Rabbit was nearly scared
out of his skin, and he &#8217;fraid to move, &#8217;cause the
bucket might keel over and spill him out into
the water.</p>

<p>Then old Br&#8217;er Fox holler out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Br&#8217;er Rabbit! Who you visiting down
there?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Me? Oh, I&#8217;m just a-fishing, Br&#8217;er
Fox,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Rabbit, says he. &ldquo;I just said
to myself that I&#8217;d sort of surprise you all with
a lot of fishes for dinner; and so here I is, and
here&#8217;s the fishes. I&#8217;m fishing, Br&#8217;er Fox,&rdquo; says
Br&#8217;er Rabbit, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there many of &#8217;em down there, Br&#8217;er Rabbit?&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of &#8217;em, Br&#8217;er Fox. Scores and scores
of &#8217;em. The water is just alive with &#8217;em. Come
down, and help me haul &#8217;em up, Br&#8217;er Fox,&rdquo; says
old Br&#8217;er Rabbit, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How &#8217;m I going to get down, Br&#8217;er Rabbit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jump into the other bucket, Br&#8217;er Fox. It&#8217;ll
fetch you down all safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he talk so happy and talk so sweet,
that Br&#8217;er Fox he jump into the bucket, he did,
and as he went down, of course his weight pulled
Br&#8217;er Rabbit up. When they passed one another
half-way down, Br&#8217;er Rabbit he sing out:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.3em;">&ldquo;Good-by, Br&#8217;er Fox, take care of your clothes,</span><br />
 For this is the way the world goes;<br />
 Some goes up, and some goes down,<br />
 You&#8217;ll get to the bottom all safe and soun&#8217;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Br&#8217;er Rabbit get out, he gallop off and
tell the folks what the well belong to that Br&#8217;er
Fox was down in there muddying up the drinking
water, and then he gallop back to the well and
holler down to Br&#8217;er Fox:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Here comes a man with a great big gun;<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">When he hauls you up, you cut and run.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>But in about half an hour both of them were
back in the new ground, working as if they
never heard of no well, &#8217;cept that every now and
then Br&#8217;er Rabbit burst out and laugh, and old
Br&#8217;er Fox he&#8217;d get a spell of the dry grins.</p></div>

<h2><a name="PEACE" id="PEACE"></a>BR&#8217;ER POSSUM LOVES PEACE</h2>


<p>One night Br&#8217;er Possum called for Br&#8217;er Coon,
and they rambled forth to see how the others
were getting along. Br&#8217;er Possum he ate his fill
of fruit, and Br&#8217;er Coon he scooped up a lot of
frogs and tadpoles. They ambled along, just as
sociable as a basket of kittens, till by-and-by they
heard Mr. Dog talking to himself off in the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&#8217;pose he runs upon us, Br&#8217;er Possum, what
you going to do?&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Coon.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Possum sort of laugh round the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he comes, Br&#8217;er Coon, I&#8217;m going to
stand by you,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Possum. &ldquo;What are
<em>you</em> going to do?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Me?&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Coon. &ldquo;If he runs
up on to me, I lay I&#8217;ll give him a twist,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog he came and he came. He didn&#8217;t
wait to say How-d&#8217;ye-do. He just sailed into the
two of them. The very first pass he made, Br&#8217;er
Possum fetched a grin from ear to ear, and keeled
over as if he was dead. Then Mr. Dog he
sailed into Br&#8217;er Coon, but Br&#8217;er Coon was cut
out for that kind of business, and he fairly
wiped up the face of the earth with Mr. Dog.
When Mr. Dog got a chance to make himself
scarce, he took it, and what was left of him went
skaddling through the woods as if it was shot
out of a gun. Br&#8217;er Coon he sort of licked his
clothes into shape, and racked off, and Br&#8217;er Possum
he lay as if he was dead, till by-and-by he
looked up, sort of careful-like, and when he found
the coast clear he scrambled up and scampered
off as if something was after him.</p>

<p>Next time Br&#8217;er Possum met Br&#8217;er Coon, Br&#8217;er
Coon refused to reply to his How-d&#8217;ye-do, and
this made Br&#8217;er Possum feel mighty bad, &#8217;cause
they used to make so many excursions together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you hold your head so high?&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Possum, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&#8217;t running with cowards these days,&rdquo; says
Br&#8217;er Coon. &ldquo;When I wants you, I&#8217;ll send for
you,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>Then Br&#8217;er Possum got very angry. &ldquo;Who&#8217;s
a coward?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You is,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Coon, &ldquo;that&#8217;s who. I
ain&#8217;t associating with them what lies down on
the ground and plays dead when there&#8217;s a free
fight going on,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>Then Br&#8217;er Possum grin and laugh fit to kill
hisself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor&#8217;! Br&#8217;er Coon, you don&#8217;t think I done that
&#8217;cause I was afraid, does you?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Why,
I were no more afraid than you is this minute.
What was there to be skeered at?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I
knew you&#8217;d get away with Mr. Dog if I didn&#8217;t,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
and I just lay there watching you shake him,
waiting to put in when the time came,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Coon turn up his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s a mighty likely tale,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;When
Mr. Dog no more than touched you before you
keeled over and lay there stiff,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s just what I was going to tell you
about,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Possum. &ldquo;I weren&#8217;t no more
skeered &#8217;n you is now, and I was going to give
Mr. Dog a sample of my jaw,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but
I&#8217;m the most ticklish chap that ever you set
eyes on, and no sooner did Mr. Dog put his
nose down among my ribs than I got to laughing,
and I laugh till I hadn&#8217;t no more use of my
limbs,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;and it&#8217;s a mercy for Mr. Dog
that I <em>was</em> ticklish, &#8217;cause a little more and I&#8217;d
have ate him up,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind fighting,
Br&#8217;er Coon, any more than you does, but
I&#8217;m blessed if I can stand tickling. Get me in
a row where there ain&#8217;t no tickling allowed, and
I&#8217;m your man,&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>And to this day Br&#8217;er Possum&#8217;s bound to surrender
when you touch him in the short ribs,
and he&#8217;ll laugh even if he knows he&#8217;s going to
be smashed for it.</p>

<p>One day Br&#8217;er Fox struck up with Br&#8217;er Tarrypin
right in the middle of the big road. Br&#8217;er
Tarrypin he heard Br&#8217;er Fox coming, and he say
to hisself that he&#8217;d sort of better keep one eye
open; but Br&#8217;er Fox was monstrous polite, and
he begin, he did, and say he hadn&#8217;t seen Br&#8217;er
Tarrypin this ever so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Br&#8217;er Tarrypin, where you been this
long-come-short?&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Fox, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lounging round,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&#8217;t look sprucy, like you did, Br&#8217;er

<p>&ldquo;Lounging round and suffering,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er
Tarrypin, says he.</p>

<p>Then the talk sort of run on like this:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
&ldquo;What ails you, Br&#8217;er Tarrypin? Your eye
look mighty red,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor, Br&#8217;er Fox, you dunno what trouble is.
<em>You</em> ain&#8217;t been lounging round and suffering,&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Both</em> eyes red, and you look like you is mighty
weak, Br&#8217;er Tarrypin,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Fox, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lor, Br&#8217;er Fox, you dunno what trouble is,&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you now?&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Took a walk the other day, and Mr. Man
come along and set the field on fire. Lor, Br&#8217;er
Fox, you dunno what trouble is,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin,
says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you get out of the fire, Br&#8217;er Tarrypin?&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sat and took it, Br&#8217;er Fox,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin,
says he, &ldquo;sat and took it; and the smoke
got in my eye, and the fire scorched my back,&rdquo;
says Br&#8217;er Tarrypin, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likewise it burn your tail off,&rdquo; says Br&#8217;er
Fox, says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, there&#8217;s my tail, Br&#8217;er Fox,&rdquo; says
Br&#8217;er Tarrypin, and with that he uncurl his tail
from under his shell, and no sooner did he do
that than Br&#8217;er Fox grab at it and holler out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Br&#8217;er Terrapin! Oh, yes! And so
you&#8217;s the one what lam me on the head the
other day, is you? You&#8217;s in with Br&#8217;er Rabbit,
is you? Well, I&#8217;m going to out you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Tarrypin he beg and he beg, but it weren&#8217;t
no use. Then he beg Br&#8217;er Fox not to drown
him. Br&#8217;er Fox ain&#8217;t making no promise. Then
he beg Br&#8217;er Fox to burn him, &#8217;cause now he used
to fire. Br&#8217;er Fox he say nothing. By-and-by
Br&#8217;er Fox drag Br&#8217;er Tarrypin off little ways
below the spring, and he souse him under the
water.</p>

<p>Then Br&#8217;er Tarrypin he began to holler out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn loose that stump-root and catch hold
of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox he holler back:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&#8217;t got hold of no stump-root, and I is
got hold of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch hold of me, I&#8217;m a-drowning&mdash;I&#8217;m
a-drowning; turn loose that stump-root and catch
hold of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, Br&#8217;er Fox turned loose Br&#8217;er
Tarrypin&#8217;s tail, and Br&#8217;er Tarrypin he went down
to the bottom!</p>

<p>Was Br&#8217;er Tarrypin drowned, then? Not a
bit of it. Is <em>you</em> drowned when your mammy
tucks you up in bed?</p></div>

<h2>HOW COUSIN WILDCAT SERVED BR&#8217;ER FOX<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></h2>


<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit and Br&#8217;er Fox had both been
paying calls one evening at the same house. They
sat there, and after a while Br&#8217;er Rabbit looked
out, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, folks and friends, I must say good-by.
Cloud coming up yonder, and before we know
it, the rain&#8217;ll be a-pouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Br&#8217;er Fox he up and says he &#8217;spects <em>he</em>
better be getting on, &#8217;cause he doesn&#8217;t want to
get his Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes wet. So
they set out.</p>

<p>While they were going down the big road,
talking at one another, Br&#8217;er Fox he took and
stopped, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Br&#8217;er Rabbit, look here! If my
eyes don&#8217;t deceive, here&#8217;s the tracks where Mr.
Dog&#8217;s been along, and they&#8217;re quite fresh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he sidle up and look. Then he
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there track ain&#8217;t never fit Mr. Dog&#8217;s
foot. What&#8217;s more,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I been acquainted
with him what made that track too long ago to
talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Br&#8217;er Rabbit, please, sir, tell me his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he laughs, as if he was making
light of something or other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I makes no mistakes, Br&#8217;er Fox, the poor
creature what made that track is Cousin Wildcat;
no more and no less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How big is he, Br&#8217;er Rabbit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just about your heft, Br&#8217;er Fox.&rdquo; Then Br&#8217;er
Rabbit make like talking to himself. &ldquo;Tut, tut,
tut! To be sure, to be sure! Many and many&#8217;s
the times I see my old grand-daddy kick and cuff
Cousin Wildcat. If you want some fun, Br&#8217;er
Fox, now&#8217;s the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox he up and axed how he&#8217;s going to
have any fun.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he say: &ldquo;Easy enough. Just go
and tackle old Cousin Wildcat, and lam him
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox he sorter scratch his ear, and say:
&ldquo;Eh, eh, Br&#8217;er Rabbit, I&#8217;m &#8217;fraid. His track too
much like Mr. Dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he sat flat down in the road, and
holler, and laugh. &ldquo;Shoo, Br&#8217;er Fox!&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;who&#8217;d ha&#8217; thought you so skeery? Just come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and look at these here tracks. Is there any sign
of claw anywheres?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox was obliged to agree that there
weren&#8217;t no sign of claw. Br&#8217;er Rabbit say: &ldquo;Well,
then, if he ain&#8217;t got no claw, how&#8217;s he going
to hurt you, Br&#8217;er Fox?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox took another good look at the track,
and then he and Br&#8217;er Rabbit put out to follow
it up.</p>

<p>They kept on and on, till by-and-by they ran
up with the creature. Br&#8217;er Rabbit he holler out
mighty biggity: &ldquo;Hallo, there! what you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creature look round, but he ain&#8217;t saying
nothing. Br&#8217;er Rabbit say: &ldquo;Oh, you needn&#8217;t
look so sulky! We&#8217;ll make you talk before we&#8217;ve
done with you! Come, now, what you doing
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creature rub hisself against a tree just as
you see these here house cats rub against a chair,
but he ain&#8217;t saying nothing. Br&#8217;er Rabbit holler:
&ldquo;What you come bothering us for when we ain&#8217;t
been bothering you? You thinks I don&#8217;t know
who you is, but I does. I&#8217;ll let you know I got a
better man here than what my grand-daddy been,
and I&#8217;ll be bound he&#8217;ll make you talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creature leaned harder against the tree,
and sort of ruffled up his bristles, but he ain&#8217;t
saying nothing. Br&#8217;er Rabbit he say: &ldquo;Go up,
Br&#8217;er Fox, and if he refuse to speak, slap him
down. That&#8217;s the way my grand-daddy did. If
he dares to run, I&#8217;ll just whirl in and catch
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox he look sort of dubious, but he start
toward the creature. Old Cousin Wildcat walk
all round the tree rubbing hisself, but he ain&#8217;t
saying nothing. Br&#8217;er Fox he went up a little
nigher. Cousin Wildcat stop rubbing on the
tree, and sat upon his behind legs with his front
paws in the air, and balances hisself by leaning
against the tree, but he ain&#8217;t saying nothing.</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Rabbit he squall out: &ldquo;Oh, you needn&#8217;t
put up your hands, and try and beg off. That&#8217;s
the way you fooled my old grand-daddy; but you
can&#8217;t fool me. All your sitting up and begging
ain&#8217;t going to help you. Hit him, Br&#8217;er Fox!
If he runs, I&#8217;ll catch him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Br&#8217;er Fox he sort of took heart. He sidled
up toward him, and just as he was making ready
to slap him, old Cousin Wildcat drew back, and
fetched Br&#8217;er Fox a wipe across the stomach.</p>

<p>That there Cousin Wildcat fetched him a wipe
across the stomach, and you might have heard
him squall for miles and miles. Little more and
the creature would have torn Br&#8217;er Fox in two.
Once the creature made a pass at him, Br&#8217;er
Rabbit knew what was going to happen, yet all
the same he took and hollered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit him again, Br&#8217;er Fox! hit him again!
I&#8217;m a-backing you, Br&#8217;er Fox! Hit him again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Br&#8217;er Rabbit was going on in this way,
Br&#8217;er Fox was squatting on the ground, holding
his stomach with both hands and moaning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m ruined, Br&#8217;er Rabbit! I&#8217;m ruined!
Fetch the doctor! I&#8217;m teetotally ruined!&rdquo;</p>

<p>About this time Cousin Wildcat took and went
for a walk. Br&#8217;er Rabbit make like he astonished
that Br&#8217;er Fox is hurted. He took and examine
the place, and he up and say: &ldquo;It look to me,
Br&#8217;er Fox, that that owdacious villain took and
struck you with a reaping hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that Br&#8217;er Rabbit lit out for home, and
when he got out of sight he took and shook his
hands, just like a cat when she gets the water
on her foots. Then he laugh and laugh till he
can laugh no more.</p></div>

<h2>PLANTATION STORIES</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><strong>BY GRACE MacGOWAN COOKE</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><strong>I.&mdash;MRS. PRAIRIE-DOG&#8217;S BOARDERS</strong></p>

<p>Texas is a near-by land to the dwellers in the
Southern States. Many of the poorer white
people go there to mend their fortunes; and not
a few of them come back from its plains, homesick
for the mountains, and with these fortunes
unmended. Daddy Laban, the half-breed, son
of an Indian father and a negro mother, who
sometimes visited Broadlands plantation, had
been a wanderer; and his travels had carried
him as far afield as the plains of southwestern
Texas. The Randolph children liked, almost
better than any others, the stories he brought
home from these extensive travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De prairie-dog a mighty cur&#8217;ous somebody,&rdquo;
he began one day, when they asked him for a
tale. &ldquo;Hit lives in de ground, more samer dan
a ground-hog. But dey ain&#8217;t come out for wood
nor water; an&#8217; some folks thinks dey goes plumb
down to de springs what feeds wells. I has
knowed dem what say dey go fur enough down
to find a place to warm dey hands&mdash;but dat
ain&#8217;t de tale I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time ago, dey was a prairie-dog
what was left a widder, an&#8217; she had a big fambly
to keep up. &lsquo;Oh, landy!&rsquo; she say to dem dat
come to visit her in her &#8217;fliction, &lsquo;what I gwine
do to feed my chillen?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De most o&#8217; de varmints tell Miz. Prairie-Dog
dat de onliest way for her to git along was
to keep boarders. &lsquo;You got a good home, an&#8217;
you is a good manager,&rsquo; dey say; &lsquo;you bound
to do well wid a boardin&#8217;-house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Miz. Prairie-Dog done sent out de
runners to run, de fliers to fly, de crawlers to
crawl, an&#8217; tell each an&#8217; every dat she sot up a
boardin&#8217;-house. She say she got room for one
crawler and one flier, an&#8217; dat she could take in
a whole passel o&#8217; runners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now you knows a flier &#8217;s a bird&mdash;or
hit mought be a bat. Ef you was lookin&#8217; for
little folks, hit mought be a butterfly. Miz.
Prairie-Dog ain&#8217;t find no fliers what wants to
live un&#8217;neath de ground. But crawlers&mdash;bugs
an&#8217; worms an&#8217; sich-like&mdash;dey mostly does live
un&#8217;neath de ground, anyhow, an&#8217; de fust pusson
what come seekin&#8217; house-room with Miz.
Prairie-Dog was Brother Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I dest been flooded out o&#8217; my own house,&rsquo;
Mr. Rattlesnake say; &lsquo;an&#8217; I like to look at your
rooms an&#8217; see ef dey suits me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I show you de rooms,&rsquo; Miz. Prairie-Dog
tell &#8217;im. &lsquo;I bound you gwine like &#8217;em. I got
room for one crawler, an&#8217; you could be him;
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miz. Prairie-Dog look at her chillen. She
ain&#8217;t say no more&mdash;dest look at dem prairie-dog
gals an&#8217; boys, an&#8217; say no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rattlesnake ain&#8217;t like bein&#8217; called a
crawler so very well; but he looks at dem
rooms, an&#8217; &#8217;low he&#8217;ll take &#8217;em. Miz. Prairie-Dog
got somethin&#8217; on her mind, an&#8217; &#8217;fore de
snake git away dat somethin&#8217; come out. &lsquo;I&#8217;s
shore an&#8217; certain dat you an&#8217; me can git along,&rsquo;
she say, &lsquo;ef&mdash;ef&mdash;ef you vow an&#8217; promish not
to bite my chillen. I&#8217;ll have yo&#8217; meals reg&#8217;lar,
so dat you won&#8217;t be tempted.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Mr. Rattlesnake&#8217; powerful high-tempered&mdash;yas,
law, he sho&#8217; a mighty quick somebody
on de trigger. Zip! he go off, dest like
dat&mdash;zip! Br-r-r! &lsquo;Tempted!&rsquo; he hiss at de
prairie-dog woman. He look at dem prairie-dog
boys an&#8217; gals what been makin&#8217; mud cakes
all mornin&#8217; (an&#8217; dest about as dirty as you-all
is after you do de same). &lsquo;Tempted,&rsquo; he say.
&lsquo;I should hope not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For, mind you, Brother Rattlesnake is a
genterman, an&#8217; belongs to de quality. He feels
hisself a heap too biggity to bite prairie-dogs.
So <em>dat</em> turned out all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;De next what come to Miz. Prairie-Dog
was a flier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bird?&rdquo; asked Patricia Randolph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, little mistis,&rdquo; returned the old Indian.

wanted to git me a home down on de ground,
so dat I could be sure, an&#8217; double sure, dat I

<h2>ROBIN REDBREAST</h2>


<p>There was once a hunter who had only one son,
and when his son grew up he said to him: &ldquo;My
son, I am growing old, and you must hunt for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, father,&rdquo; said his son, and he took
his father&#8217;s bow and arrows and went out into the
woods. But he was a dreamy boy, and forgot
what he had come for, and spent the morning
wondering at the beautiful flowers, and trees, and
mosses, and hills, and valleys that he saw. When
he saw a bird on a tree, he forgot that he had
come to shoot it, and lay listening to its song; and
when he saw a deer come down to drink at the
stream he put down his bow and arrows and began
to talk to the deer in the deer&#8217;s own language.
At last he saw that the sun was setting.
Then he looked round for his bow and arrows,
and they were gone!</p>

<p>When he got home to the wigwam, his father
met him at the door and said: &ldquo;My son, you have
had a long day&#8217;s hunting. Have you killed so
much that you had to leave it in the woods? Let
us go and fetch it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man looked very much ashamed of
himself, and said: &ldquo;Father, I forgot all about the
hunting. The woods, and the sky, and the flowers,
and the birds, and the beasts were so interesting
that I forgot all about what you had sent
me to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father was in a terrible rage with him, and
in the morning he sent him out again, with new
bow and arrows, saying: &ldquo;Take care that you
don&#8217;t forget this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The son went along saying to himself: &ldquo;I
mustn&#8217;t forget, I mustn&#8217;t forget, I mustn&#8217;t forget.&rdquo;
But as soon as a bird flew across the path
he forgot all about what his father had said, and
called to the bird in the bird&#8217;s own language, and
the bird came and sat on the tree above him, and
sang to him so beautifully all day that the young
man sat as if he was dreaming till sunset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;what shall I
do? My father will kill me if I go back without
anything to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the bird; &ldquo;if he kills you,
we shall give you feathers and paint, and you can
fly away and be a bird like ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the young man reached the village he
scarcely dared to go near his father&#8217;s wigwam;
but his father saw him coming, and ran to meet
him, calling out in a hurry; &ldquo;What have you
brought? What have you brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought nothing, father; nothing at
all,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>His father was angrier than ever, and in the
morning he said: &ldquo;Come with me. No more bow
and arrows for you, and not a bite to eat, till I
have taught you to be a hunter like any other
good Indian.&rdquo; So he took his son into the middle
of the forest, and there built for him a little wigwam,
with no door, only a little hole in the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said his father, when the young man
was inside, and the wigwam was laced up tight.
&ldquo;When you have lived and fasted in this wigwam
for twelve days, the spirit of a hunter will come
into you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every day the young man&#8217;s father came to see
him, and every day the young man begged for
food, till at last, on the tenth day, he could only
beg in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;In two days more you
can both hunt and eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the eleventh day, when the father came and
spoke to his son, he got no answer. Looking
through the hole, he saw the lad lying as if he
was dead on the ground; but when he called out
aloud his son awoke, and whispered: &ldquo;Father,
bring me food! Give me some food!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You have only one day
more to wait. To-morrow you will hunt and eat.&rdquo;
And he went away home to the village.</p>

<p>On the twelfth day the father came loaded
with meal and meat. As he came near to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
wigwam he heard a curious chirping sound, and
when he looked through the hole in the wigwam
he saw his son standing up inside, and painting
his breast with bright red paint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, my son? Come and eat!
Here is meal and meat for you. Come and eat
and hunt like a good Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the son could only reply in a chirping little
voice: &ldquo;It is too late, father. You have killed me
at last, and now I am becoming a bird.&rdquo; And as
he spoke he turned into the o-pe-che&mdash;the robin
redbreast&mdash;and flew out of the hole and away to
join the other birds; but he never flew very far
from where men live.</p>

<p>The cruel father set out to go back to his wigwam;
but he could never find the village again,
and after he had wandered about a long time he
lay down in the forest and died; and soon afterward
the redbreast found him, and buried him
under a heap of dry leaves. Every year after that,
when the time of the hunter&#8217;s fast came round,
the redbreast perched on his father&#8217;s empty wigwam
and sang the song of the dead.</p>

<h2><a name="WISHES" id="WISHES"></a>THE THREE WISHES</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there were three brothers who
set out on a visit to Goose-cap, the wise one, who
said that any one might come and see him, and
get a wish&mdash;just one wish, no more. The three
brothers were seven years on the journey, climbing
mountains that seemed to have no top, and
scrambling through forests full of thorn-bushes,
and wading through swamps where the mosquitoes
tried to eat them up, and sailing down rivers
where the rapids broke up their rafts and nearly
drowned them.</p>

<p>At the end of seven years they heard Goose-cap&#8217;s
dogs barking, so then they knew they were
on the right road; and they went on for three
months more, and the barking got a little louder
every day, till at last they came to the edge of
the great lake. Then Goose-cap saw them, and
sailed over in his big stone canoe and took them
to his island.</p>

<p>You never saw such a beautiful island as that
was, it was so green and warm and bright; and
Goose-cap feasted his visitors for three days and
nights, with meats and fruits that they had never
tasted before. Then he said: &ldquo;Tell me what you
want, and why you have taken so much trouble
to find me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youngest brother said: &ldquo;I want to be always
amusing, so that no one can listen to me without
laughing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the great wise one stuck his finger in the
ground, and pulled up a root of the laughing-plant
and said: &ldquo;When you have eaten this you will be
the funniest man in the tribe, and people will
laugh as soon as you open your lips. But see that
you don&#8217;t eat it till you get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youngest brother thanked him, and hurried
away; and going home was so easy that it
only took seven days instead of seven years. Yet
the young man was so impatient to try his wish
that on the sixth morning he ate the root. All of
a sudden he felt so light-headed that he began to
dance and shout with fun: and the ducks that he
was going to shoot for breakfast flew away laughing
into the reeds over the river, and the deer
ran away laughing into the woods, and he got
nothing to eat all day.</p>

<p>Next morning he came to the village where he
lived, and he wanted to tell his friends how hungry
he was; but at the first word he spoke they
all burst out laughing, and as he went on they
laughed louder and louder&mdash;it seemed so funny,
though they couldn&#8217;t hear a word he said, they
made so much noise themselves. Then they got
to laughing so hard that they rolled over and over
on the ground, and squeezed their sides, and cried
with laughing, till they had to run away into their
houses and shut their doors, or they would have
been killed with laughing. He called to them to
come out and give him something to eat, but as
soon as they heard him they began to laugh
again; and at last they shouted that if he didn&#8217;t
go away they would kill him. So he went away
into the woods and lived by himself; and whenever
he wanted to hunt he had to tie a strap over
his mouth, or the mock-bird would hear him and
begin to laugh, and all the other birds and beasts
would hear the mock-bird and laugh and run
away.</p>

<p>The second brother said to Goose-cap; &ldquo;I want
to be the greatest of hunters without the trouble
of hunting. Why should I go after the animals
if I could make them come to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goose-cap knew why; still, he gave the man a
little flute, saying: &ldquo;Be sure you don&#8217;t use it till
after you have got home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the hunter set off; but on the sixth day he
was getting so near home that he said to himself:
&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure Goose-cap couldn&#8217;t hear me now if I
blew the flute <em>very</em> gently, just to try it.&rdquo; So he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
pulled out the flute and breathed into it as gently
as ever he could&mdash;but as soon as his lips touched
it the flute whistled so long and loud that all the
beasts in the country heard it and came rushing
from north and south and east and west to see
what the matter was. The deer got there first,
and when they saw it was a man with bow and
arrows they tried to run away again; but they
couldn&#8217;t, for the bears were close behind, all
round, and pushed and pushed till the deer were
all jammed up together and the man was squeezed
to death in the middle of them.</p>

<p>The eldest brother, when the other two had set
off for home, said to Goose-cap: &ldquo;Give me great
wisdom, so that I can marry the Mohawk chief&#8217;s
daughter without killing her father or getting
killed myself.&rdquo; You see, the eldest brother was
an Algonquin, and the Mohawks always hated
the Algonquins.</p>

<p>Goose-cap stooped down on the shore and
picked up a hard clam-shell; and he ground it and
ground it, all that day and all the next night, till
he had made a beautiful wampum bead of it.
&ldquo;Hang this round your neck by a thread of flax,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and go and do whatever the chief asks
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eldest brother thanked him, and left the
beautiful island, and traveled seven days and
seven nights till he came to the Mohawk town.
He went straight to the chief&#8217;s house, and said to
him, &ldquo;I want to marry your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;you can marry
my daughter if you bring me the head of the
great dragon that lives in the pit outside the
gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eldest brother promised he would, and
went out and cut down a tree and laid it across
the mouth of the pit. Then he danced round the
pit, and sang as he danced a beautiful Algonquin
song, something like this: &ldquo;Come and eat me,
dragon, for I am fat and my flesh is sweet and
there is plenty of marrow in my bones.&rdquo; The
dragon was asleep, but the song gave him beautiful
dreams, and he uncoiled himself and smacked
his lips and stretched his head up into the air and
laid his neck on the log. Then the eldest brother
cut off the head; snick-snack, and carried it to the
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s right,&rdquo; said the chief; but he was
angry in his heart, and next morning, when he
should have given away his daughter, he said to
the Algonquin: &ldquo;I will let you marry her if I see
that you can dive as well as the wild duck in the
lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they got to the lake the wild duck dived
and stayed under water for three minutes, but
then it had to come up to breathe. Then the
eldest brother dived, and turned into a frog, and
stayed under water so long that they were sure
he was drowned; but just as they were going
home, singing for joy to be rid of him, he
came running after them, and said: &ldquo;Now I
have had my bath and we can go and get
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till the evening,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;and
then you can get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the evening came, the Northern Lights
were dancing and leaping in the sky, and the chief
said: &ldquo;The Northern Lights would be angry if
you got married without running them a race.
Run your best and win, and there will be no more
delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Northern Lights darted away at once to
the west, and the eldest brother ran after them;
and the chief said to his daughter: &ldquo;They will
lead him right down to the other side of the
world, and he will be an old man before he can
get back, so he won&#8217;t trouble us any more.&rdquo; But
just as the chief finished speaking, here came the
Algonquin running up from the east. He had
turned himself into lightning and gone right
round the world; and the night was nearly gone
before the Northern Lights came up after him,
panting and sputtering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said the chief; &ldquo;you have won
the race; so now we can go on with the wedding.
The place where we have our weddings is down
by the river at the bottom of the valley, and we
will go there on our toboggans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the hillside was rough with rocks and
trees, and the river flowed between steep precipices,
so nobody could toboggan down there without
being broken to pieces. But the eldest brother
said he was ready, and asked the chief to come
on the same toboggan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;but as soon as you have
started I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Algonquin gave his toboggan a push,
and jumped on, and didn&#8217;t even take the trouble
to sit down. The chief waited to see him dashed
to pieces; but the toboggan skimmed down the
mountain side without touching a rock or a tree,
and flew across the ravine at the bottom, and up
the hillside opposite; and the Algonquin was
standing straight up the whole time. When he
got to the top of the mountain opposite he turned
his toboggan round and coasted back as he had
come. And when the chief saw him coming near
and standing up on his toboggan, he lost his temper
and let fly an arrow straight at the young
man&#8217;s heart; but the arrow stuck in Goose-cap&#8217;s
bead, and the Algonquin left it sticking there and
took no notice. Only when he got to the top he
said to the chief, &ldquo;Now it&#8217;s your turn,&rdquo; and put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
him on the toboggan and sent him spinning down
into the valley. And whether the chief ever came
up again we don&#8217;t know; but at any rate his
daughter married the Algonquin without any
more fuss, and went home with him.</p>

<h2><a name="JOKER" id="JOKER"></a>THE JOKER</h2>


<p>This story is about Lox. He called himself the
joker, and he was very proud of his jokes; but
nobody else could see anything in them to laugh
at.</p>

<p>One day he came to a wigwam where two old
Indians were taking a nap beside the fire. He
picked out a burning stick, held it against their
bare feet, and then ran out and hid behind the
tent. The old men sprang up, and one of them
shouted to the other:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you burn my feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare <em>you</em> burn <em>my</em> feet?&rdquo; roared the
other, and sprang at his throat.</p>

<p>When he heard them fighting Lox laughed out
loud, and the old men ran out to catch the man
who had tricked them. When they got round the
tent they found nothing but a dead coon. They
took off its skin, and put its body into the pot of
soup that was boiling for dinner. As soon as they
had sat down, out jumped Lox, kicking over the
pot and putting out the fire with the soup. He
jumped right into the coon&#8217;s skin and scurried
away into the wood.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forest Lox came upon a
camp where a party of women were sitting round
a fire making pouches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Lox, looking very kind. (He
had put on his own skin by this time.) &ldquo;That&#8217;s
very slow work! Now, when I want to make a
pouch I do it in two minutes, without sewing a
stitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see you do it!&rdquo; said one of
the women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he. So he took a piece of
skin, and a needle and twine, and a handful of
beads, and stuffed them in among the burning
sticks. In two minutes he stooped down again
and pulled a handsome pouch out of the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; said the women; and they all
stuffed their pieces of buckskin and handfuls of
beads into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure you pull the bags out in two minutes,&rdquo;
said Lox. &ldquo;I will go and hunt for some more
buckskin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In two minutes the women raked out the fire,
and found nothing but scraps of scorched leather
and half-melted glass. Then they were very
angry, and ran after the joker; but he had turned
himself into a coon again and hidden in a hollow
tree. When they had all gone back to their ruined
work he came down and went on his mischievous
way.</p>

<p>When he came out of the wood he saw a village
by the side of a river. Outside one of the wigwams
a woman was nursing a baby, and scolding
it because it cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lot of trouble children are,&rdquo; said Lox.
&ldquo;What a pity that people don&#8217;t make men of
them at once, instead of letting them take years
to grow up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman stared. &ldquo;How can a baby be turned
into a man?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&#8217;s easy enough,&rdquo; said he. So she lent
him her baby, and he took it down to the river
and held it under the water for a few minutes,
saying magical words all the time; and then a
full-grown Indian jumped out of the water, with
a feather head-dress, and beaded blankets, and a
bow and quiver slung over his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo; said his mother,
and she hurried back to the village to tell her
friends the secret. The last thing Lox saw as he
hurried away into the wood was a score of mothers
drowning their children.</p>

<p>On the path in front of him Lox spied a couple
of maidens, and they were trying to reach the
fruit that grew on a wild plum-tree. The joker
stepped on one side and broke a twig off another
plum-tree and stuck it in his hair. The twig
sprouted fast, and grew into a little plum-tree
with big plums hanging from its twigs. He went
along the path, picking and eating the plums as
he walked, till he came up with the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Do you think we
could get plums like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; said he and he broke off two little
twigs. &ldquo;Stick these in your hair, and you will
have head-dresses like mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the twigs were stuck in their hair
the little plum-trees began to grow, and the maidens
danced with joy, and picked the juicy plums
and ate them. But the trees went on growing,
and the roots twisted in among the maidens&#8217; hair
and clutched their heads like iron fingers. The
girls sat down, for they couldn&#8217;t carry all that
weight standing. And still the trees grew, till
the girls lay down on the ground and screamed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
for some one to come and rescue them. Presently
their father came along, and he pulled his axe out
of his belt and chopped off the trees, and tugged
at the roots till they came off&mdash;but all the maidens&#8217;
hair came off too. By this time Lox took
care to be scampering away through the wood in
the shape of a coon.</p>

<p>When he came near the next village Lox put on
a terrified face and began to run; and he rushed
into the middle of the village, shouting: &ldquo;The
plague is coming! The plague is coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the people flocked out of their wigwams,
crying: &ldquo;Where is it coming from? Which way
shall we fly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are and make your minds
easy,&rdquo; said Lox. &ldquo;I have a charm that will keep
off all the plagues under the sun. As soon as I
have spoken the words, every man must kiss the
girl nearest him.&rdquo; Then he stretched up his hands
toward the sun and said some gibberish; and
when he stopped and let his arms fall, each man
made a rush and kissed the girl who happened to
be nearest.</p>

<p>But there were not quite as many girls as there
were men, and one old bachelor was so slow and
clumsy that every girl had been kissed before he
could catch one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Lox cheerfully. &ldquo;You go
to the next village and try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the old bachelor set out, plod, plod, plodding
through the woods. But Lox turned himself into
a coon again, and scampered from tree to tree,
and got first to the village. When he told the
people the plague was coming, and they asked
how they could avoid it, he said: &ldquo;When I have
spoken my charm, all the girls must set upon any
stranger that comes to the village, and beat him.&rdquo;
Then he flung his arms up and began talking his
gibberish. Presently the old bachelor came up,
hot and panting, and stood close to the handsomest
girl he could see, all ready to kiss her as soon
as the charm ended. But as soon as Lox finished,
the maidens all set upon the stranger, and beat
him till he ran away into the woods.</p>

<p>Then the people made a great feast for Lox;
and when he had eaten his fill of deer-meat and
honey, he marched off to play his tricks somewhere
else. He had not gone very far when he
came to the Kulloo&#8217;s nest. Now the Kulloo was
the biggest of the birds, and when he spread his
wings he made night come at noonday; and he
built his nest of the biggest pine-trees he could
find, instead of straws. The Kulloo was away,
but his wife was at home trying to hatch her
eggs. Lox was not hungry; but he turned himself
into a serpent, and crept into the nest and
under Mrs. Kulloo&#8217;s wing, and bit a hole in every
egg and ate up the little Kulloos. When he had
done this, he was so heavy and stupid that he
couldn&#8217;t walk very far before he had to lie down
and go to sleep.</p>

<p>Presently the Kulloo came home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on, my dear?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very well, I&#8217;m afraid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
eggs seem to get cold, no matter how close I
sit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take a turn while you go and stretch
your wings,&rdquo; said the Kulloo. But when he sat
down on the empty eggs they all broke with a
great crash.</p>

<p>The Kulloo flew off in a terrible rage to find
the wretch who had eaten up the eggs, and very
soon he spied Lox snoring on the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&#8217;ve caught him,&rdquo; said the Kulloo; &ldquo;it&#8217;s
Lox, the mischief-maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pounced down, and caught hold of Lox by
the hair and carried him a mile up into the sky,
and then let go. Of course, Lox was broken into
pieces when he struck the earth, but he just had
time as he fell to say his strongest magic:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
&ldquo;Backbone! Backbone!<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">Save my backbone!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>So as soon as the Kulloo was out of sight the
arms and legs and head began to wriggle together
round the backbone, and then in a twinkling Lox
was whole again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&#8217;t like that to happen very often,&rdquo; he
said, looking himself over to see if every piece
had joined in the right place. &ldquo;I think I&#8217;ll go
home and take a rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he had traveled so far that he was six
months&#8217; journey from his home; and he had made
so many enemies, and done so much mischief, that
whenever he came into a village and asked food
and shelter the people hooted and pelted him out
again. The birds and the beasts got to know
when he was coming, and kept so far out of his
way that he couldn&#8217;t get enough to eat, not even
by his magic. Besides, he had wasted his magic
so much that scarcely any was left. The winter
came on, and he was cold as well as hungry, when
at last he reached a solitary wigwam by a frozen
river. The master of the wigwam didn&#8217;t know
him, so he treated him kindly, and said, when they
parted next morning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have only three days more to go; but the
frost-wind is blowing colder and colder, and if
you don&#8217;t do as I say you will never get home.
When night comes, break seven twigs from a
maple-tree and stand them up against each other,
like the poles of a wigwam, and jump over them.
Do the same the next night, and the night after
that if you are not quite home; but you can only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
do it thrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away went the joker, swaggering through the
woods as if nothing had happened to him, for now
he was warm and full. But soon the wind began
to rise, and it blew sharper and sharper, and bit
his face, and pricked in through his blanket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not going to be cold while I know how to
be warm,&rdquo; said he; and he built a little wigwam
of sticks, and jumped over it. The sticks blazed
up, and went on burning furiously for an hour.
Then they died out suddenly. Lox groaned and
went on his way. In the afternoon he stopped
again, and lit another fire to warm himself by;
but again the fire went out. When night came on
he made his third fire wigwam; and that one
burned all night long, and only went out when it
was time for him to begin the day&#8217;s march.</p>

<p>All day he tramped over the snow, never daring
to stop for more than a few minutes at a time for
fear of being frozen to death. At night he built
another little wigwam; but the twigs wouldn&#8217;t
light, however often he jumped over them. On
he tramped, getting more and more tired and
drowsy, till at last he fell in his tracks and froze.
And that was the end of Lox and his jokes.</p>

<h2><a name="RIDE" id="RIDE"></a>LITTLE MOCCASIN&#8217;S<br />
RIDE ON THE THUNDER-HORSE</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY COLONEL GUIDO ILGES</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;Little Moccasin&rdquo; was, at the time we speak of,
fourteen years old, and about as mischievous a
boy as could be found anywhere in the Big Horn
mountains. Unlike his comrades of the same age,
who had already killed buffaloes and stolen
horses from the white men and the Crow Indians,
with whom Moccasin&#8217;s tribe, the Uncapapas, were
at war, he preferred to lie under a shady tree in
the summer, or around the camp-fire in winter,
listening to the conversation of the old men and
women, instead of going upon expeditions with
the warriors and the hunters.</p>

<p>The Uncapapas were a very powerful and numerous
tribe of the great Sioux Nation, and before
Uncle Sam&#8217;s soldiers captured and removed them,
and before the Northern Pacific Railroad entered
the territory of Montana, they occupied the beautiful
valleys of the Rosebud, Big and Little Horn,
Powder and Redstone rivers, all of which empty
into the grand Yellowstone Valley. In those days,
before the white man had set foot upon these
grounds, there was plenty of game, such as buffalo,
elk, antelope, deer, and bear; and, as the
Uncapapas were great hunters and good shots,
the camp of Indians to which Little Moccasin belonged
always had plenty of meat to eat and
plenty of robes and hides to sell and trade for
horses and guns, for powder and ball, for sugar
and coffee, and for paint and flour. Little Moccasin
showed more appetite than any other Indian
in camp. In fact, he was always hungry, and
used to eat at all hours, day and night. Buffalo
meat he liked the best, particularly the part taken
from the hump, which is so tender that it almost
melts in the mouth.</p>

<p>When Indian boys have had a hearty dinner of
good meat, they generally feel very happy and
very lively. When hungry, they are sad and dull.</p>

<p>This was probably the reason why Little Moccasin
was always so full of mischief, and always
inventing tricks to play upon the other boys. He
was a precocious and observing youngster, full of
quaint and original ideas&mdash;never at a loss for expedients.</p>

<p>But he was once made to feel very sorry for
having played a trick, and I must tell my young
readers how it happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Running Antelope,&rdquo; one of the great warriors
and the most noted orator of the tribe, had returned
from a hunt, and Mrs. Antelope was frying
for him a nice buffalo steak&mdash;about as large
as two big fists&mdash;over the coals. Little Moccasin,
who lived in the next street of tents, smelled the
feast, and concluded that he would have some of
it. In the darkness of the night he slowly and
carefully crawled toward the spot, where Mistress
Antelope sat holding in one hand a long stick, at
the end of which the steak was frying. Little
Moccasin watched her closely, and seeing that
she frequently placed her other hand upon the
ground beside her and leaned upon it for support,
he soon formed a plan for making her drop the
steak.</p>

<p>He had once or twice in his life seen a pin, but
he had never owned one, and he could not have
known what use is sometimes made of them by
bad white boys. He had noticed, however, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
some of the leaves of the larger varieties of the
prickly-pear cactus-plant are covered with many
thorns, as long and as sharp as an ordinary pin.</p>

<p>So when Mrs. Antelope again sat down and
looked at the meat to see if it was done, he slyly
placed half-a-dozen of the cactus leaves upon the
very spot of ground upon which Mrs. Antelope
had before rested her left hand.</p>

<p>Then the young mischief crawled noiselessly
into the shade and waited for his opportunity,
which came immediately.</p>

<p>When the unsuspecting Mrs. Antelope again
leaned upon the ground, and felt the sharp points
of the cactus leaves, she uttered a scream, and
dropped from her other hand the stick and the
steak, thinking only of relief from the sharp pain.</p>

<p>Then, on the instant, the young rascal seized
the stick and tried to run away with it. But Running
Antelope caught him by his long hair, and
gave him a severe whipping, declaring that he
was a good-for-nothing boy, and calling him a
&ldquo;coffee-cooler&rdquo; and a &ldquo;squaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other boys, hearing the rumpus, came running
up to see the fun, and they laughed and
danced over poor Little Moccasin&#8217;s distress.
Often afterward they called him &ldquo;coffee-cooler&rdquo;;
which meant that he was cowardly and faint-hearted,
and that he preferred staying in camp
around the fire, drinking coffee, to taking part in
the manly sports of hunting and stealing expeditions.</p>

<p>The night after the whipping, Little Moccasin
could not sleep. The disgrace of the whipping
and the name applied to him were too much for
his vanity. He even lost his appetite, and refused
some very nice prairie-dog stew which his mother
offered him.</p>

<p>He was thinking of something else. He must
do something brave&mdash;perform some great deed
which no other Indian had ever performed&mdash;in
order to remove this stain upon his character.</p>

<p>But what should it be? Should he go out alone
and kill a bear? He had never fired a gun, and
was afraid that the bear might eat him. Should
he attack the Crow camp single-handed? No, no&mdash;not
he; they would catch him and scalp him
alive.</p>

<p>All night long he was thinking and planning;
but when daylight came, he had reached no conclusion.
He must wait for the Great Spirit to
give him some ideas.</p>

<p>During the following day he refused all food
and kept drawing his belt tighter and tighter
around his waist every hour, till, by evening, he
had reached the last notch. This method of appeasing
the pangs of hunger, adopted by the Indians
when they have nothing to eat, is said to be
very effective.</p>

<p>In a week&#8217;s time Little Moccasin had grown
almost as thin as a bean-pole, but no inspiration
had yet revealed what he could do to redeem himself.</p>

<p>About this time a roving band of Cheyennes,
who had been down to the mouth of the Little
Missouri, and beyond, entered the camp upon a
friendly visit. Feasting and dancing were kept up
day and night, in honor of the guests; but Little
Moccasin lay hidden in the woods nearly all the
time.</p>

<p>During the night of the second day of their
stay, he quietly stole to the rear of the great council-tepee,
to listen to the pow-wow then going on.
Perhaps he would there learn some words of wisdom
which would give him an idea how to carry
out his great undertaking.</p>

<p>After &ldquo;Black Catfish,&rdquo; the great Cheyenne
warrior, had related in the flowery language of
his tribe some reminiscences of his many fights
and brave deeds, &ldquo;Strong Heart&rdquo; spoke. Then
there was silence for many minutes, during which
the pipe of peace made the rounds, each warrior
taking two or three puffs, blowing the smoke
through the nose, pointing toward heaven and
then handing the pipe to his left-hand neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong Heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crazy Dog,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bow-String,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dog-Fox,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Smooth Elkhorn&rdquo; spoke of the
country they had just passed through.</p>

<p>Then again the pipe of peace was handed round,
amid profound silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Pipe,&rdquo; who was bent and withered with
the wear and exposure of seventy-nine winters,
and who trembled like some leafless tree shaken
by the wind, but who was sound in mind and
memory, then told the Uncapapas, for the first
time, of the approach of a great number of white
men, who were measuring the ground with long
chains, and who were being followed by &ldquo;Thundering
Horses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Houses on Wheels.&rdquo; (He
was referring to the surveying parties of the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, who were
just then at work on the crossing of the Little
Missouri.)</p>

<p>With heart beating wildly, Little Moccasin listened
to this strange story and then retired to his
own blankets in his father&#8217;s tepee.</p>

<p>Now he had found the opportunity he so long
had sought! He would go across the mountains,
all by himself, look at the thundering horses and
the houses on wheels. He then would know more
than any one in the tribe, and return to the camp,&mdash;a
hero!</p>

<p>At early morn, having provided himself with a
bow and a quiver full of arrows, without informing
any one of his plan he stole out of camp, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
running at full speed, crossed the nearest mountain
to the East.</p>

<p>Allowing himself little time for rest, pushing
forward by day and night, and after fording many
of the smaller mountain-streams, on the evening
of the third day of his travel he came upon what
he believed to be a well-traveled road. But&mdash;how
strange!&mdash;there were two endless iron rails lying
side by side upon the ground. Such a curious sight
he had never beheld. There were also large poles,
with glass caps, and connected by wire, standing
along the roadside. What could all this mean?</p>

<p>Poor Little Moccasin&#8217;s brain became so bewildered
that he hardly noticed the approach of a
freight-train drawn by the &ldquo;Thundering Horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shrill, long-drawn whistle, and immense
clouds of black smoke; and the Thundering
Horse was sniffing and snorting at a great
rate, emitting from its nostrils large streams of
steaming vapor. Besides all this, the earth, in the
neighborhood of where Little Moccasin stood,
shook and trembled as if in great fear; and to him
the terrible noises the horse made were perfectly
appalling.</p>

<p>Gradually the snorts, and the puffing, and the
terrible noise lessened, until, all at once, they entirely
ceased. The train had come to a stand-still
at a watering tank, where the Thundering Horse
was given its drink.</p>

<p>The rear car, or &ldquo;House on Wheels,&rdquo; as old
Black Pipe had called it, stood in close proximity
to Little Moccasin,&mdash;who, in his bewilderment
and fright at the sight of these strange moving
houses, had been unable to move a step.</p>

<p>But as no harm had come to him from the terrible
monster, Moccasin&#8217;s heart, which had sunk
down to the region of his toes, began to rise
again; and the curiosity inherent in every Indian
boy mastered fear.</p>

<p>He moved up, and down, and around the great
House on Wheels; then he touched it in many
places, first with the tip-end of one finger, and
finally with both hands. If he could only detach
a small piece from the house to take back to camp
with him as a trophy and as a proof of his daring
achievement! But it was too solid, and all made
of heavy wood and iron.</p>

<p>At the rear end of the train there was a ladder,
which the now brave Little Moccasin ascended
with the quickness of a squirrel to see what there
was on top.</p>

<p>It was gradually growing dark, and suddenly
he saw (as he really believed) the full moon approaching
him. He did not know that it was the
headlight of a locomotive coming from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Absorbed in this new and glorious sight, he did
not notice the starting of his own car, until it was
too late, for, while the car moved, he dared not
let go his hold upon the brake-wheel.</p>

<p>There he was, being carried with lightning
speed into a far-off, unknown country, over
bridges, by the sides of deep ravines, and along
the slopes of steep mountains.</p>

<p>But the Thundering Horse never tired nor grew
thirsty again during the entire night.</p>

<p>At last, soon after the break of day, there came
the same shrill whistle which had frightened him
so much on the previous day; and, soon after, the
train stopped at Miles City.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for our little hero, there
were a great many white people in sight; and he
was compelled to lie flat upon the roof of his car,
in order to escape notice. He had heard so much
of the cruelty of the white men that he dared not
trust himself among them.</p>

<p>Soon they started again, and Little Moccasin
was compelled to proceed on his involuntary journey,
which took him away from home and into
unknown dangers.</p>

<p>At noon, the cars stopped on the open prairie to
let Thundering Horse drink again. Quickly, and
without being detected by any of the trainmen, he
dropped to the ground from his high and perilous
position. Then the train left him&mdash;all alone in
an unknown country.</p>

<p>Alone? Not exactly; for, within a few minutes,
half-a-dozen Crow Indians, mounted on
swift ponies, are by his side, and are lashing him
with whips and lassoes.</p>

<p>He has fallen into the hands of the deadliest
enemies of his tribe, and has been recognized by
the cut of his hair and the shape of his moccasins.</p>

<p>When they tired of their sport in beating poor
Little Moccasin so cruelly, they dismounted and
tied his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>Then they sat down upon the ground to have a
smoke and to deliberate about the treatment of
the captive.</p>

<p>During the very severe whipping, and while
they were tying his hands, though it gave him
great pain, Little Moccasin never uttered a groan.
Indian-like, he had made up his mind to &ldquo;die
game,&rdquo; and not to give his enemies the satisfaction
of gloating over his sufferings. This, as will
be seen, saved his life.</p>

<p>The leader of the Crows, &ldquo;Iron Bull,&rdquo; was in
favor of burning the hated Uncapapa at a stake,
then and there; but &ldquo;Spotted Eagle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blind
Owl,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hungry Wolf&rdquo; called attention to the
youth and bravery of the captive, who had endured
the lashing without any sign of fear. Then
the two other Crows took the same view. This
decided poor Moccasin&#8217;s fate; and he understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
it all, although he did not speak the Crow language,
for he was a great sign-talker, and had
watched them very closely during their council.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/img375.jpg" width="404" height="500" alt="Image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;when they had gone about five miles from camp,
they came upon a pretty little mouse-colored pony&rdquo;</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blind Owl, who seemed the most kind-hearted
of the party, lifted the boy upon his pony, Blind
Owl himself getting up in front, and they rode at
full speed westward to their large encampment,
where they arrived after sunset.</p>

<p>Little Moccasin was then relieved of his bonds,
which had benumbed his hands during the long
ride, and a large dish of boiled meat was given
to him. This, in his famished condition, he relished
very much. An old squaw, one of the wives
of Blind Owl, and a Sioux captive, took pity on
him, and gave him a warm place with plenty of
blankets in her own tepee, where he enjoyed a
good rest.</p>

<p>During his stay with the Crows, Little Moccasin
was made to do the work which usually falls
to the lot of the squaws; and which was imposed
upon him as a punishment upon a brave enemy,
designed to break his proud spirit. He was treated
as a slave, made to haul wood and draw water, do
the cooking, and clean game. Many of the Crow
boys wanted to kill him, but his foster-mother,
&ldquo;Old Looking-Glass,&rdquo; protected him; and, besides,
they feared that the soldiers of Fort Custer might
hear of it, if he was killed, and punish them.</p>

<p>Many weeks thus passed, and the poor little
captive grew more despondent and weaker in
body every day. Often his foster-mother would
talk to him in his own language, and tell him to
be of good cheer; but he was terribly homesick
and longed to get back to the mountains on the
Rosebud, to tell the story of his daring and become
the hero which he had started out to be.</p>

<p>One night, after everybody had gone to sleep in
camp, and the fires had gone out, Old Looking-Glass,
who had seemed to be soundly sleeping,
approached his bed and gently touched his face.
Looking up, he saw that she held a forefinger
pressed against her lips, intimating that he must
keep silence, and that she was beckoning him to
go outside.</p>

<p>There she soon joined him; then, putting her
arm around his neck, she hastened out of the
camp and across the nearest hills.</p>

<p>When they had gone about five miles away
from camp, they came upon a pretty little mouse-colored
pony, which Old Looking-Glass had hidden
there for Little Moccasin on the previous
day.</p>

<p>She made him mount the pony, which she called
&ldquo;Blue Wing,&rdquo; and bade him fly toward the rising
sun, where he would find white people who would
protect and take care of him.</p>

<p>Old Looking-Glass then kissed Little Moccasin
upon both cheeks and the forehead, while the
tears ran down her wrinkled face; she also folded
her hands upon her breast and looking up to the
heavens, said a prayer, in which she asked the
Great Spirit to protect and save the poor boy in
his flight.</p>

<p>After she had whispered some indistinct words
into the ear of Blue Wing (who seemed to understand
her, for he nodded his head approvingly),
she bade Little Moccasin be off, and advised him
not to rest this side of the white man&#8217;s settlement,
as the Crows would soon discover his absence,
and would follow him on their fleetest ponies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Blue Wing will save you! He can outrun
them all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were her parting words, as he galloped
away.</p>

<p>In a short time the sun rose over the nearest
hill, and Little Moccasin then knew that he was
going in the right direction. He felt very happy
to be free again, although sorry to leave behind
his kind-hearted foster-mother, Looking-Glass.
He made up his mind that after a few years,
when he had grown big and become a warrior, he
would go and capture her from the hated Crows
and take her to his own tepee.</p>

<p>He was so happy in this thought that he had
not noticed how swiftly time passed, and that
already the sun stood over his head; neither had
he urged Blue Wing to run his swiftest; but that
good little animal kept up a steady dog-trot, without,
as yet, showing the least sign of being tired.</p>

<p>But what was the sudden noise which was
heard behind him? Quickly he turned his head,
and, to his horror, he beheld about fifty mounted
Crows coming toward him at a run, and swinging
in their hands guns, pistols, clubs, and knives!</p>

<p>His old enemy, Iron Bull, was in advance, and
under his right arm he carried a long lance, with
which he intended to spear Little Moccasin, as
a cruel boy spears a bug with a pin.</p>

<p>Moccasin&#8217;s heart stood still for a moment with
fear; he knew that this time they would surely
kill him if caught. He seemed to have lost all
power of action.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came Iron Bull, shouting at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p>But Blue Wing now seemed to understand the
danger of Moccasin&#8217;s situation; he pricked up his
ears, snorted a few times, made several short
jumps, to fully arouse Moccasin, who remained
paralyzed with fear, and then, like a bird, fairly
flew over the prairie, as if his little hoofs were
not touching the ground.</p>

<p>Little Moccasin, too, was now awakened to his
peril, and he patted and encouraged Blue Wing;
while, from time to time, he looked back over his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
shoulder to watch the approach of Iron Bull.</p>

<p>Thus they went, on and on; over ditches and
streams, rocks and hills, through gulches and valleys.
Blue Wing was doing nobly, but the pace
could not last forever.</p>

<p>Iron Bull was now only about five hundred
yards behind and gaining on him.</p>

<p>Little Moccasin felt the cold sweat pouring
down his face. He had no fire-arm, or he would
have stopped to shoot at Iron Bull.</p>

<p>Blue Wing&#8217;s whole body seemed to tremble beneath
his young rider, as if the pony was making
a last desperate effort, before giving up from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Little Moccasin did not know
how to pray, or he might have found some comfort
and help thereby; but in those moments,
when a terrible death was so near to him, he did
the next best thing: he thought of his mother and
his father, of his little sisters and brothers, and
also of Looking-Glass, his kind old foster-mother.</p>

<p>Then he felt better and was imbued with fresh
courage. He again looked back, gave one loud,
defiant yell at Iron Bull, and then went out of
sight over some high ground.</p>

<p>Ki-yi-yi-yi! There is the railroad station just
in front, only about three hundred yards away.
He sees white men around the buildings, who will
protect him.</p>

<p>At this moment Blue Wing utters one deep
groan, stumbles, and falls to the ground. Fortunately,
though, Little Moccasin has received no
hurt. He jumps up, and runs toward the station
as fast as his weary legs can carry him.</p>

<p>At this very moment Iron Bull with several of
his braves came in sight again, and, realizing the
helpless condition of the boy, they all gave a shout
of joy, thinking that in a few minutes they would
capture and kill him. But their shouting had been
heard by some of the white men, who at once
concluded to protect the boy, if he deserved aid.</p>

<p>Little Moccasin and Iron Bull reached the door
of the station-building at nearly the same moment;
but the former had time enough to dart inside
and hide under the table of the telegraph
operator.</p>

<p>When Iron Bull and several other Crows
rushed in to pull the boy from underneath the
table, the operator quickly took from the table-drawer
a revolver, and with it drove the murderous
Crows from the premises.</p>

<p>Then the boy had to tell his story, and he was
believed. All took pity upon his forlorn condition,
and his brave flight made them his friends.</p>

<p>In the evening Blue Wing came up to where
Little Moccasin was resting and awaiting the arrival
of the next train, which was to take him
back to his own home.</p>

<p>Little Moccasin threw his arms affectionately
around Blue Wing&#8217;s neck, vowing that they never
would part again in life.</p>

<p>Then they both were put aboard a lightning
express train, which look them to within a short
distance of the old camp on the Rosebud.</p>

<p>When Little Moccasin arrived at his father&#8217;s
tepee, riding beautiful Blue Wing, now rested and
frisky, the whole camp flocked around him; and
when he told them of his great daring, of his capture
and his escape, Running Antelope, the big
warrior of the Uncapapas and the most noted
orator of the tribe, proclaimed him a true hero,
and then and there begged his pardon for having
called him a &ldquo;coffee-cooler.&rdquo; In the evening Little
Moccasin was honored by a great feast and
the name of &ldquo;Rushing Lightning,&rdquo; <em>Wakee-watakeepee</em>,
was bestowed upon him&mdash;and by that
name he is known to this day.</p>

<h2>WAUKEWA&#8217;S EAGLE</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY JAMES BUCKHAM</strong></p>

<p>NE day, when the Indian boy Waukewa was hunting along
the mountain-side, he found a young eagle with a broken
wing, lying at the base of a cliff. The bird had
fallen from an aerie on a ledge high above, and
being too young to fly, had fluttered down the cliff
and injured itself so severely that it was likely to
die. When Waukewa saw it he was about to drive one
of his sharp arrows through its body, for the passion
of the hunter was strong in him, and the
eagle plunders many a fine fish from the Indian&#8217;s
drying-frame. But a gentler impulse came to him
as he saw the young bird quivering with pain and
fright at his feet, and he slowly unbent his bow,
put the arrow in his quiver, and stooped over the
panting eaglet. For fully a minute the wild eyes
of the wounded bird and the eyes of the Indian
boy, growing gentler and softer as he gazed,
looked into one another. Then the struggling and
panting of the young eagle ceased; the wild,
frightened look passed out of its eyes, and it suffered
Waukewa to pass his hand gently over its
ruffled and draggled feathers. The fierce instinct
to fight, to defend its threatened life, yielded to
the charm of the tenderness and pity expressed in
the boy&#8217;s eyes; and from that moment Waukewa
and the eagle were friends.</p>

<p>Waukewa went slowly home to his father&#8217;s
lodge, bearing the wounded eaglet in his arms.
He carried it so gently that the broken wing gave
no twinge of pain, and the bird lay perfectly still,
never offering to strike with its sharp beak the
hands that clasped it.</p>

<p>Warming some water over the fire at the lodge,
Waukewa bathed the broken wing of the eagle
and bound it up with soft strips of skin. Then he
made a nest of ferns and grass inside the lodge,
and laid the bird in it. The boy&#8217;s mother looked
on with shining eyes. Her heart was very tender.
From girlhood she had loved all the creatures of
the woods, and it pleased her to see some of her
own gentle spirit waking in the boy.</p>

<p>When Waukewa&#8217;s father returned from hunting,
he would have caught up the young eagle and
wrung its neck. But the boy pleaded with him so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
eagerly, stooping over the captive and defending
it with his small hands, that the stern warrior
laughed and called him his &ldquo;little squaw-heart.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep it, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and nurse it until it is
well. But then you must let it go, for we will
not raise up a thief in the lodges.&rdquo; So Waukewa
promised that when the eagle&#8217;s wing was healed
and grown so that it could fly, he would carry it
forth and give it its freedom.</p>

<p>It was a month&mdash;or, as the Indians say, a moon&mdash;before
the young eagle&#8217;s wing had fully mended
and the bird was old enough and strong enough
to fly. And in the meantime Waukewa cared for
it and fed it daily, and the friendship between the
boy and the bird grew very strong.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;he stooped over<br />

</div>

<p>But at last the time came when the willing captive
must be freed. So Waukewa carried it far
away from the Indian lodges, where none of the
young braves might see it hovering over and be
tempted to shoot their arrows at it, and there he
let it go. The young eagle rose toward the sky
in great circles, rejoicing in its freedom and its
strange, new power of flight. But when Waukewa
began to move away from the spot, it came swooping
down again; and all day long it followed him
through the woods as he hunted. At dusk, when
Waukewa shaped his course for the Indian lodges,
the eagle would have accompanied him. But the
boy suddenly slipped into a hollow tree and hid,
and after a long time the eagle stopped sweeping
about in search of him and flew slowly and sadly
away.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;the young eagle rose<br />

</div>

<p>Summer passed, and then winter; and spring
came again, with its flowers and birds and swarming
fish in the lakes and streams. Then it was
that all the Indians, old and young, braves and
squaws, pushed their light canoes out from shore
and with spear and hook waged pleasant war
against the salmon and the red-spotted trout.
After winter&#8217;s long imprisonment, it was such
joy to toss in the sunshine and the warm wind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and catch savory fish to take the place of dried
meats and corn!</p>

<p>Above the great falls of the Apahoqui the salmon
sported in the cool, swinging current, darting
under the lee of the rocks and leaping full
length in the clear spring air. Nowhere else
were such salmon to be speared as those which
lay among the riffles at the head of the Apahoqui
rapids. But only the most daring braves ventured
to seek them there, for the current was strong,
and should a light canoe once pass the danger-point
and get caught in the rush of the rapids,
nothing could save it from going over the roaring
falls.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning of a clear April day,
just as the sun was rising splendidly over the
mountains, Waukewa launched his canoe a half-mile
above the rapids of the Apahoqui, and
floated downward, spear in hand, among the salmon-riffles.
He was the only one of the Indian
lads who dared fish above the falls. But he had
been there often, and never yet had his watchful
eye and his strong paddle suffered the current to
carry his canoe beyond the danger-point. This
morning he was alone on the river, having risen
long before daylight to be first at the sport.</p>

<p>The riffles were full of salmon, big, lusty fellows,
who glided about the canoe on every side in
an endless silver stream. Waukewa plunged his
spear right and left, and tossed one glittering victim
after another into the bark canoe. So absorbed
in the sport was he that for once he did
not notice when the head of the rapids was
reached and the canoe began to glide more swiftly
among the rocks. But suddenly he looked up,
caught his paddle, and dipped it wildly in the
swirling water. The canoe swung sidewise, shivered,
held its own against the torrent, and then
slowly, inch by inch, began to creep upstream toward
the shore. But suddenly there was a loud,
cruel snap, and the paddle parted in the boy&#8217;s
hands, broken just above the blade! Waukewa
gave a cry of despairing agony. Then he bent to
the gunwale of his canoe and with the shattered
blade fought desperately against the current. But
it was useless. The racing torrent swept him
downward; the hungry falls roared tauntingly in
his ears.</p>

<p>Then the Indian boy knelt calmly upright in the
canoe, facing the mist of the falls, and folded his
arms. His young face was stern and lofty. He
had lived like a brave hitherto&mdash;now he would
die like one.</p>

<p>Faster and faster sped the doomed canoe toward
the great cataract. The black rocks glided
away on either side like phantoms. The roar of
the terrible waters became like thunder in the
boy&#8217;s ears. But still he gazed calmly and sternly
ahead, facing his fate as a brave Indian should.
At last he began to chant the death-song, which
he had learned from the older braves. In a few
moments all would be over. But he would come
before the Great Spirit with a fearless hymn
upon his lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadow fell across the canoe. Waukewa
lifted his eyes and saw a great eagle hovering
over, with dangling legs, and a spread of
wings that blotted out the sun. Once more the
eyes of the Indian boy and the eagle met; and
now it was the eagle who was master!</p>

<p>With a glad cry the Indian boy stood up in his
canoe, and the eagle hovered lower. Now the
canoe tossed up on that great swelling wave that
climbs to the cataract&#8217;s edge, and the boy lifted
his hands and caught the legs of the eagle. The
next moment he looked down into the awful gulf
of waters from its very verge. The canoe was
snatched from beneath him and plunged down the
black wall of the cataract; but he and the struggling
eagle were floating outward and downward
through the cloud of mist. The cataract roared
terribly, like a wild beast robbed of its prey. The
spray beat and blinded, the air rushed upward as
they fell. But the eagle struggled on with his
burden. He fought his way out of the mist and
the flying spray. His great wings threshed the
air with a whistling sound. Down, down they
sank, the boy and the eagle, but ever farther from
the precipice of water and the boiling whirlpool
below. At length, with a fluttering plunge, the
eagle dropped on a sand-bar below the whirlpool,
and he and the Indian boy lay there a minute,
breathless and exhausted. Then the eagle slowly
lifted himself, took the air under his free wings,
and soared away, while the Indian boy knelt on
the sand, with shining eyes following the great
bird till he faded into the gray of the cliffs.</p>

<h2>A HURON CINDERELLA</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY HOWARD ANGUS KENNEDY</strong></p>


<p>Many years ago there was an Indian chief who
had three daughters; and they lived in a lodge by
the side of the Ottawa River&mdash;not in a wigwam,
mind you, but a good old Huron lodge, like a
tunnel, made of two rows of young trees bent
into arches and tied together at the top, with
walls of birch-bark. Oh! it was an honorable
old lodge, with more cracks in the birch-bark
than you could count, all patched and smeared
with pitch.</p>

<p>The chief had three sons too, but they were
killed in a great fight with the Iroquois. When
the brave Hurons used up all their arrows they
threw down their bows and rushed on the Iroquois
with their tomahawks. They screamed and
howled like eagles and wolves, and the Iroquois
were so frightened that they wanted to run away,
but their own magic-man threw a spell upon
them, so that they couldn&#8217;t turn round or run,
and they had to stand and fight. The Iroquois
were cousins of the Hurons, and came of a brave
stock; and as the Hurons were few compared to
the Iroquois, few as the thumbs compared to the
fingers, the Hurons were beaten, and only twenty
men of the tribe escaped down the river, and
none of the women except the chief&#8217;s three
daughters.</p>

<p>Now the two eldest daughters were very proud,
and loved to make a fine show before the young
men of the tribe. One day a brave young man
came to the lodge and asked the chief to give
him a daughter for a wife.</p>

<p>The chief said, &ldquo;It is not right for me to give
my daughter to any but a chief&#8217;s son.&rdquo; However,
he called his eldest daughter and said to her,
&ldquo;This young man wants you for a wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eldest daughter thought in her mind: &ldquo;I
am very handsome, and one day a chief&#8217;s son
will come and ask for me; but my clothes are old
and common. I will deceive this young man.&rdquo;
So she said to him: &ldquo;If you want me for your
wife, get me a big piece of the fine red cloth that
the white men bring to the fort far down the
river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man was brave, as we have said,
and he took his birch-bark canoe and paddled
down the river day after day for seven days, only
stopping to paddle up the creeks where the
beavers build their dams; and when he stopped
at the foot of the great rapids, where the white
men lay behind stone walls in fear of the Iroquois,
his canoe was deep and heavy with the
skins of the beavers. The white men were at
war with the Indians, and, though he was no
Iroquois, his heart grew cold in his breast. But
he did not tremble; he marched in at the watergate,
and the white men were glad to see his
beaver skins, and gave him much red cloth for
them; so his heart grew warm again, and he
paddled up the river with his riches. Twelve
days he paddled, for the current was strong
against him; but at last he stood outside the old
lodge, and called the chief&#8217;s eldest daughter to
come out and be his wife. When she saw how
red was his load, she was glad and sorry&mdash;glad
because of the cloth, and sorry because of the
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are the beads?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked me for no beads,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Was it ever heard that a
chief&#8217;s daughter married in clothing of plain red
cloth? If you want me for your wife, bring me
a double handful of the glass beads that the
Frenchmen bring from over the sea&mdash;red and
white and blue and yellow beads!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the brave paddled off in his canoe down the
river. When he came to the beavers&#8217; creeks he
found the dams and the lodges; but the beavers
were gone. He followed them up the creeks till
the water got so shallow that the rocks tore holes
in his canoe, and he had to stop and strip fresh
birch-bark to mend the holes; but at last he
found where the beavers were building their new
dams; and he loaded his canoe with their skins,
and paddled away and shot over the rapids, and
came to the white man&#8217;s fort. The white men
passed their hands over the skins and felt that
they were good, and gave him a double handful
of beads. Then he paddled up the river, paddling
fast and hard, so that when he stood before the
old chief&#8217;s lodge he was very thin.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter came out when he called,
and said: &ldquo;It is a shame for such an ugly man
to have a chief&#8217;s daughter for his wife. You are
not a man; you are only the bones of a man, like
the poles of the lodge when the bark is stripped
away. Come back when you are fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went away to his lodge, and ate and
slept and ate and slept till he was fat, and he
made his face beautiful with red clay and went
and called to the chief&#8217;s daughter to come and
marry him. But she called out to him, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A chief&#8217;s daughter must have time to embroider
her clothes. Come back when I have
made my cloth beautiful with a strip of beadwork
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
a hand&#8217;s-breadth wide from end to end of
the cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">

<span class="caption">flute player<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">from a painting by j. h. sharp</span></span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>But she was very lazy as well as proud, and
she took the cloth to her youngest sister, and
said: &ldquo;Embroider a beautiful strip, a hand&#8217;s-breadth
wide, from end to end of the cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the chief&#8217;s youngest daughter was very
beautiful; so her sisters were jealous and made
her live in the dark corner at the back of the
lodge, where no man could see her; but her eyes
were very bright, and by the light of her eyes she
arranged the beads and sewed them on so that
the pattern was like the flowers of the earth and
the stars of heaven, it was so beautiful. But
when the youngest daughter had fallen asleep at
night her eldest sister came softly and took away
the cloth and picked off the beads.</p>

<p>In the morning she went to her youngest sister
and said, &ldquo;Show me the work you did yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the youngest sister cried, and said, &ldquo;Truly
I worked as well as I could, but some evil one
has picked out the beads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then her sister scolded her, and pricked her
with the needle, and said, &ldquo;You are lazy! Embroider
this cloth, and do it beautifully, or I shall
beat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This she did day after day, and whenever the
young man came to see if she was dressed for the
wedding she showed him the cloth, and it was
not finished.</p>

<p>Now there was another brave young man in
that village, and he came and asked the chief for
his second daughter.</p>

<p>The second daughter was as proud as the first,
and said to herself, &ldquo;One day a great chief&#8217;s son
will come, and I will marry him.&rdquo; But she said
to the young man, &ldquo;If you want me for your
wife, you must build me a new lodge, and cover
the door of it with a curtain of beaver-skins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man smiled in his heart, for he said
to himself, &ldquo;This is easy; this is child&#8217;s play.&rdquo; So
he built a new lodge, and hung a curtain of
beaver-skins over the door.</p>

<p>But when the chief&#8217;s daughter saw the curtain,
she said, &ldquo;I should be ashamed to live behind a
curtain of plain beaver-skins like that! Go and
hunt for porcupines, that the curtain may be embroidered
with their quills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he took his bow and his arrows and went
away through the woods to hunt. Twelve days
he marched, till he came to the porcupines&#8217; country.
When the porcupines saw him coming; they
ran to meet him, crying out, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t kill us! We
will give you all the quills that you want.&rdquo; And
while he stood doubting, the porcupines turned
round, and shot their prickly quills out at him so
that they stuck in his body. And the porcupines
ran away into hiding before he could shoot.</p>

<p>Then the young man, because he had been gone
so long already, did not chase the porcupines, but
left the quills sticking in his body and went back
to the village, saying to himself, &ldquo;She will see
how brave I am, that I care nothing for the pain
of the porcupine quills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when the chief&#8217;s daughter saw him she
only laughed and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot deceive me! It was never heard
that a chief&#8217;s daughter married a man who was
not brave. If you were brave, you would have
twenty Iroquois scalps hanging from your belt.
It is easy to hunt porcupines; go and hunt the
Iroquois, that I may embroider the curtain black
and white with the porcupine-quills and the Iroquois
hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the young man&#8217;s heart grew cold; but he
took his bow and arrows and went through the
woods; and when he came near the Iroquois town
he lay down on his face and slipped through the
bushes like a snake. When an Iroquois came to
hunt in the woods, he shot the Iroquois and took
his scalp; and this he did till he had twenty scalps
on his belt.</p>

<p>Now all the time that he lay in the bushes by
the Iroquois town he ate nothing but wild strawberries,
for the blueberries were not yet ripe; so
when he came to his own village and called to
the chief&#8217;s second daughter, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an ill-looking man for a chief&#8217;s
daughter to marry. You are like a porcupine-quill
yourself. Nevertheless, I am not like my
sister, and I will marry you as soon as the curtain
is embroidered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she took the curtain of beaver-skin and
gave it to her youngest sister, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Embroider this curtain with quills, black and
white, and criss-cross, so that it shall be more
beautiful than the red cloth and the beadwork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the youngest sister, when she had done her
day&#8217;s work on the cloth, and was tired and ready
to sleep, took the quills and the hair and began
to embroider the curtain, black and white, in
beautiful patterns like the boughs of the trees
against the sky, till she could work no longer,
and fell asleep with her chin on her breast.</p>

<p>Then her second sister came with her mischievous
fingers and picked out all the embroidery
of quills and hair, and in the morning
came and shook her and waked her, and said,
&ldquo;You are lazy! you are lazy! Embroider this
curtain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this way the youngest sister&#8217;s task was
doubled, and she grew thin for want of sleep;
yet she was so beautiful, and her eyes shone so
brightly, that her sisters hated her more and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
more, for they said to themselves, &ldquo;If a great
chief&#8217;s son comes this way, he will see her eyes
shining even in the dark at the back of the
lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day, when the chief looked out of his
door, he saw a new lodge standing in the middle
of the village, covered with buckskin, and painted
round with pictures of wonderful beasts that had
never been seen in that country before. There
was a fire in front of the lodge, and the haunch
of a deer was cooking on the fire. When the
chief went and stood and looked in at the door,
the lodge was empty, and he said, &ldquo;Whose can
this lodge be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a voice close by him said, &ldquo;It is the lodge
of a chief who is greater than any chief of the
Hurons or any chief of the Iroquois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked the old chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sitting beside my fire,&rdquo; said the voice;
&ldquo;but you cannot see me, for your eyes are turned
inward. No one can see me but the maiden I
have come to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no maidens here,&rdquo; said the old
chief, &ldquo;except my daughters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went back to his lodge, where his two
elder daughters were idling in the sun, and told
them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a great chief come to seek a wife
in my tribe. His magic is so strong that no one
can see him except the maiden whom he chooses
to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the eldest daughter got up, snatched the
red cloth out of her youngest sister&#8217;s hand,
wrapped it round her, smeared red clay over her
face, and ran to the new lodge and called to the
great chief to come and look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am looking at you now,&rdquo; said a voice close
beside her; &ldquo;and you are very ugly; you have
been dipping your face in the mud. And you are
very lazy, for your embroidery is not finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great chief,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will wash the clay
from my face, and I will go and finish the embroidery
and make a robe fit for a maiden who is
to marry the great chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the voice said, &ldquo;How can you marry a
man you cannot see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can see you as plainly as the
lodge and the fire. I can see you quite plainly,
sitting beside the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell me what I am like,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the handsomest of men,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;straight of back and brown of skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;and learn to speak
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she came back to the lodge, she flung
the red cloth down on the ground without speaking.</p>

<p>Then the old chief said to his second daughter,
&ldquo;Your sister has failed; it must be you that the
great chief will marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the second daughter picked up the beaver
curtain and flung it round her, and ran to the
empty lodge; and, being crafty, she cried aloud
as she came near, &ldquo;Oh! What a handsome chief
you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know I am handsome?&rdquo; said the
voice. &ldquo;Tell me what clothes I wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she guessed in her mind, and, looking on
the painted lodge, she said, &ldquo;A robe of buckskin,
with wonderful animals painted on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;and learn to speak
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she slunk away home, and squatted on
the ground before the lodge, with her chin on her
breast.</p>

<p>Now, when the youngest daughter saw that
both her sisters had failed, she said to herself,
&ldquo;They tell me I am very thin and ugly, but I will
go and try if I can see this great chief.&rdquo; So she
pushed aside a corner of the birch-bark, slipped
out at the back of the lodge, and stole away to
the painted lodge; and there, sitting by his fire
on the ground, she saw a wonderful great chief,
with skin as white as midwinter snow, dressed in
a long robe of red and blue and green and yellow
stripes.</p>

<p>He smiled on her as she stood humbly before
him, and said, &ldquo;Tell me now, chief&#8217;s daughter,
what I am like, and what I wear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she said, &ldquo;Your face is like a cloud in the
north when the sun shines bright from the south;
and your robe is like the arch in the sky when
the sun shines on the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he stood up and took her for his wife,
and carried her away to live in his own country.</p>

<h2>THE FIRE BRINGER<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY MARY AUSTIN</strong></p>


<p>They ranged together by wood and open swale,
the boy who was to be called Fire Bringer, and
the keen, gray dog of the wilderness, and saw
the tribesmen catching fish in the creeks with their
hands, and the women digging roots with sharp
stones. This they did in Summer, and fared
well; but when Winter came they ran nakedly in
the snow, or huddled in caves of the rocks, and
were very miserable. When the boy saw this
he was very unhappy, and brooded over it until
the Coyote noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because my people suffer and have no
way to escape the cold,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not feel it,&rdquo; said the Coyote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because of your coat of good fur,
which my people have not, except they take it in
the chase, and it is hard to come by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them run about, then,&rdquo; said the counselor,
&ldquo;and keep warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They run till they are weary,&rdquo; said the boy;
&ldquo;and there are the young children and the very
old. Is there no way for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Coyote, &ldquo;let us go to the
hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will hunt no more,&rdquo; the boy answered him,
&ldquo;until I have found a way to save my people from
the cold. Help me, O counselor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Coyote had run away. After a time
he came back and found the boy still troubled in
his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a way, O Man Friend,&rdquo; said the
Coyote, &ldquo;and you and I must take it together,
but it is very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not fail of my part,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will need a hundred men and women,
strong, and swift runners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find them,&rdquo; the boy insisted, &ldquo;only tell
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; said the Coyote, &ldquo;to the Burning
Mountain by the Big Water and bring fire
to our people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said the boy: &ldquo;What is fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Coyote considered a long time how
he should tell the boy what fire is. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;red like a flower, yet it is no flower; neither
is it a beast, though it runs in the grass and rages
in the wood and devours all. It is very fierce
and hurtful, and stays not for asking; yet if it is
kept among stones and fed with small sticks, it
will serve the people well and keep them warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it to be come at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has its lair in the Burning Mountain; and
the Fire Spirits guard it night and day. It is a
hundred days&#8217; journey from this place, and because
of the jealousy of the Fire Spirits no man
dare go near it. But I, because all beasts are
known to fear it much, may approach it without
hurt, and, it may be, bring you a brand from the
burning. Then you must have strong runners
for every one of the hundred days to bring it
safely home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and get them,&rdquo; said the boy; but it
was not so easily done as said. Many there were
who were slothful, and many were afraid; but
the most disbelieved it wholly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;how should this boy tell us
of a thing of which we have never heard!&rdquo;
But at last the boy and their own misery persuaded
them.</p>

<p>The Coyote advised them how the march should
begin. The boy and the counselor went foremost;
next to them the swiftest runners, with the others
following in the order of their strength, and
speed. They left the place of their home and
went over the high mountains where great jagged
peaks stand up above the snow, and down the
way the streams led through a long stretch of
giant wood where the somber shade and the
sound of the wind in the branches made them
afraid. At nightfall, where they rested, one
stayed in that place, and the next night another
dropped behind; and so it was at the end of each
day&#8217;s journey. They crossed a great plain where
waters of mirage rolled over a cracked and parching
earth, and the rim of the world was hidden
in a bluish mist. So they came at last to another
range of hills, not so high, but tumbled thickly
together; and beyond these, at the end of the hundred
days, to the Big Water, quaking along the
sand at the foot of the Burning Mountain.</p>

<p>It stood up in a high and peaked cone, and the
smoke of its burning rolled out and broke along
the sky. By night the glare of it reddened the
waves far out on the Big Water, when the Fire
Spirits began their dance.</p>

<p>Then said the counselor to the boy who was
soon to be called the Fire Bringer: &ldquo;Do you stay
here until I bring you a brand from the burning;
be ready and right for running, and lose
no time, for I shall be far spent when I come
again, and the Fire Spirits will pursue me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="caption">the coyote stole the fire and began to run away with it
down the slope of the burning mountain</span>
</div><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then he went up the mountain, and the Fire
Spirits, when they saw him come, were laughing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
and very merry, for his appearance was much
against him. Lean he was, and his coat much
the worse for the long way he had come. Slinking
he looked, inconsiderable, scurvy, and mean,
as he has always looked, and it served him as
well then as it serves him now. So the Fire
Spirits only laughed, and paid him no further
heed.</p>

<p>Along in the night, when they came out to
begin their dance about the mountain, the Coyote
stole the fire and began to run away with it down
the slope of the Burning Mountain. When the
Fire Spirits saw what he had done, they streamed
out after him red and angry in pursuit, with a
sound like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>The boy saw them come, and stood up in his
place clean-limbed and taut for running. He saw
the sparks of the brand stream back along the
Coyote&#8217;s flanks as he carried it in his mouth,
and stretched forward on the trail, bright against
the dark bulk of the mountain like a falling star.
He heard the singing sound of the Fire Spirits
behind, and the labored breath of the counselor
nearing through the dark. Then the good beast
panted down beside him, and the brand dropped
from his jaws.</p>

<p>The boy caught it up, standing bent for the running
as a bow to speeding the arrow. Out he
shot on the homeward path, and the Fire Spirits
snapped and sung behind him. Fast as they pursued
he fled faster, until he saw the next runner
stand up in his place to receive the brand.</p>

<p>So it passed from hand to hand, and the Fire
Spirits tore after it through the scrub until they
came to the mountains of the snows. These
they could not pass; and the dark, sleek runners
with the backward-streaming brand bore it forward,
shining star-like in the night, glowing red
through sultry noons, violet pale in twilight
glooms, until they came in safety to their own
land. Here they kept it among stones, and fed
it with small sticks, as the Coyote had advised,
until it warmed them and cooked their food.</p>

<p>As for the boy by whom fire came to the tribes,
he was called the Fire Bringer while he lived;
and after that, since there was no other with so
good a right to the name, it fell to the Coyote;
and this is the sign that the tale is true, for all
along his lean flanks the fur is singed and yellow
as it was by the flames that blew backward
from the brand when he brought it down from the
Burning Mountain.</p>

<p>As for the fire, that went on broadening and
brightening, and giving out a cheery sound until
it broadened into the light of day.</p></div>

<h2><a name="SCAR" id="SCAR"></a>SCAR FACE</h2>

<p class="center"><em>An Indian Tale</em></p>


<p>The mother of Scar Face the Youth was
Feather Woman, who had fallen in love with
Morning Star, and vowed that she would marry
none other. To this she held true, despite the
laughter and jibes of her friends. And one morning
when she walked in the fields very, very
early, that she might see Morning Star before the
sun hid his brightness, she met a handsome youth
who told her that he was Morning Star, and that
he had come to earth for a day, impelled by
her love.</p>

<p>So Feather Woman went back to Skyland with
Morning Star, and by-and-by a little son was born
to her. At first she had been very happy in
Skyland, but there were times when she was
sad because of the camp of the Blackfeet, which
she had left.</p>

<p>Now, in Skyland Feather Woman often dug in
the garden, and she had been cautioned not to
uproot the turnip, lest evil befall. After she was
given this charge she looked long at the turnip
and wondered what evil might come from its
uprooting. At last she took her flint and dug
around the least bit, not wanting to uproot it;
but hardly had she loosened the turnip when it
came out of the ground, and she looked down
through the hole which it had made in the sky
and saw the camp of the Blackfeet spread before
her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she began to weep for her friends;
and when her father-in-law, the Sun, saw her
weeping, he said: &ldquo;You have dug up the turnip
and have looked down at the camp of the Blackfeet.
Now must you return thither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the star-weavers made a net, and Feather
Woman and her child, the son of Morning Star,
were let down into the camp of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>At first she was very happy, but soon she began
to grieve for Morning Star, and at last she died
of sorrow because she could not return to Skyland.
Morning Star could not come to earth,
for it had been given to him to come but that
one time when impelled by her love.</p>

<p>And so the little son of Feather Woman and
Morning Star was left all alone. And across
his face was a great scar, which had been made
there when he had been let down from Skyland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
in the net woven by the star-weavers. Because
of this scar he was named, and because of it he
was very ugly, so that the children of the tribe
were afraid of him, and the older folks hated
him; they said that evil must be in his heart
that he should have so ugly a face.</p>

<p>But there was no evil in the heart of Scar
Face, and he hunted and fished alone, and became
a great hunter, bringing home much meat to the
tribe.</p>

<p>But he was not happy, because of the unfriendliness
of the tribe. The Chief had a very
beautiful daughter, and all the young men of the
tribe loved her; and Scar Face, too, loved her,
and longed to marry her.</p>

<p>So at last he went to her and told her of his
love, and asked her to marry him; and she, thinking
to jest, said: &ldquo;I will marry you when you
take that ugly scar from your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Scar Face was more sad than he had
been before, for he did not see how it was possible
to get rid of the scar. But he loved the
Chief&#8217;s daughter very much, and at last he went
to the old Medicine Man of the tribe to ask
him what he could do to get rid of the scar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do nothing,&rdquo; replied the Medicine
Man. &ldquo;The scar was put there by the Sun, and
only the Sun can take it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go to the Sun and ask him to take
away the scar,&rdquo; said Scar Face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will do that,&rdquo; replied the Medicine
Man, &ldquo;you must journey far to the west, where
the land ends and where the Big Water is. And
when you come to the Big Water at sunset you
will see a long trail, marked by a golden light,
which leads to the home of the Sun. Follow
the trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Scar Face set out and went to where the
land ends and the Big Water is. And he sat by
the Big Water until sunset, and he saw the
trail as the Medicine Man had said. Then he
followed the trail, and came at last to Skyland,
where he was greeted by Morning Star, who knew
him at once for his son.</p>

<p>Morning Star was most glad at the coming of
his son, and they hunted and fished together. And
one day when they were hunting they came to
a deep cavern in which was a dreadful serpent,
which attacked Morning Star and would have
killed him but that Scar Face quickly cut off
its head.</p>

<p>Then the Sun was grateful to Scar Face for
saving the life of his son, Morning Star, and he
removed the scar from the face of his grandson,
which he had put there in anger at the child&#8217;s
mother.</p>

<p>Then Scar Face went back to the tribe of the
Blackfeet, and he was the most handsome of all
the youths; and the daughter of the Chief loved
him, and he had no difficulty in persuading her to
marry him. Because he loved his father, Morning
Star, he took her with him and set out again
for the place where the land ends and the Big
Water begins; and together they followed the
trail marked by golden light until they came at
last to Skyland. There they lived and were
happy; and Morning Star shone with especial
brightness on the camp of the Blackfeet for their
sake.</p>

<h2><a name="BABY" id="BABY"></a>WHY THE BABY SAYS &ldquo;GOO&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>RETOLD BY EHRMA G. FILER</strong></p>


<p>On a sloping highland near the snow-capped
mountains of the North was an Indian village.
The Chief of the village was a very brave man,
and he had done many wonderful things.</p>

<p>These were the days of magic and witchery.
The Ice Giants had attempted to raid the land;
some wicked Witches had tried to cast an evil
spell over the people; and once a neighboring
colony of Dwarfs had tried to invade the village.</p>

<p>But the brave Chief had fought and conquered
all these forces of evil and magic. He was so
successful and so good that the people loved him
very much. They thought he could do anything.</p>

<p>Then before long the Chief himself began to
be proud and vain. He had conquered everyone;
so he thought he was the greatest warrior in the
world.</p>

<p>One day he boastfully said: &ldquo;I can conquer
anything or any person on this earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, a certain Wise Old Woman lived in this
village. She knew one whom the Chief could
not conquer. She decided it was best for the
Chief to know this, for he was getting too vain.
So one day she went to the Chief and told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granny, who is this marvelous person?&rdquo; asked
the Chief, half angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We call him Wasis,&rdquo; she solemnly answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show him to me,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;I will
prove that I can conquer him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old grandmother led the way to her own
wigwam. A great crowd followed to see what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
would happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said the Wise Old Woman; and
she pointed to a dear little Indian baby, who sat,
round-eyed and solemn, sucking a piece of sugar.</p>

<p>The Chief was astonished. He could not
imagine what the old woman meant, for he was
sure he could make a little baby obey him. This
Chief had no wife, and knew nothing about babies.
He stepped up closer to the baby, and
looking seriously at him said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby, come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Wasis merely smiled back at him and
gurgled, &ldquo;Goo, Goo,&rdquo; in true baby fashion.</p>

<p>The Chief felt very queer. No one had ever
answered him so before. Then he thought, perhaps
the baby did not understand; so he stepped
nearer and said kindly: &ldquo;Baby, come here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goo, Goo!&rdquo; answered baby, and waved his little
dimpled hand.</p>

<p>This was an open insult, the Chief felt; so he
called out loudly: &ldquo;Baby, come here at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This frightened little Wasis, and he opened his
little mouth and began to cry. The Chief had
never before heard such a noise. He drew back,
and looked helplessly around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, little Wasis shouts back war-cries,&rdquo;
said the Wise Old Woman.</p>

<p>This angered the Chief, and he said: &ldquo;I will
overcome him with my magic power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began to mutter queer songs, and to
dance around the baby.</p>

<p>This pleased little Wasis, and he smiled and
watched the Chief, never moving to go to him.
He just sat and sucked his sugar.</p>

<p>At last the Chief was tired out. His red paint
was streaked with sweat; his feathers were falling,
and his legs ached. He sat down and looked
at the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not say that baby is mightier than you?&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;No one is mightier than he. A baby
rules the wigwam, and everyone obeys him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is truly so,&rdquo; said the Chief, and went outside.</p>

<p>The last sound he heard as he walked away was
the &ldquo;Goo, Goo&rdquo; of little Wasis as he crowed in
victory. It <em>was</em> his war-cry. All babies mean
just that when they gurgle so at you.</p>
